good location affordable price one bad surprise  we were looking for an affordable place to stay in boston and we got an amazing deal at the best western through a travel agency for 130 night free parking and breakfast included this 3star hotel was more than what we expected checkin was very easy reception staff was very helpful manager was friendly breakfast was acceptable room was clean and of decent size bathroom was very clean no complaints until the last morning when right before checkout we realized that we had shared the room with a mouse or some other rodent   a chocolate bar had small bite marks all over it as if some animal had tried to eat it through the wrapper  as we were leaving anyway we did not make a big fuss out of it the employee at the reception made a note of it and told us that they have had a rodent problem in the past  it might just be bad luck we might even go back to this hotel as the location and price are unbeatable but we will definitely never leave any food or candies in our room again ,0.06875,0.041875,neutral,4,3,3,4

pleasantly surprised i ve been by this hotel many times since i live in the area i always thought it looked kind of sketchy situated as it is immediately behind a gas station on commonwealth avenue  which could also be convenient too i guess  but one night i got locked out of my apartment and so needed a quick easy inexpensive place to stay this place worked out great and is fine if you are looking for a safe clean reasonably priced nofrills option in bostonwhich is hard to find the room itself was larger and nicer than i expectedalthough the blaze orange bedspreads need to be updated the price was fairyou could easily pay double the amount in downtown boston the location is in the allstonbrighton neighborhood just west of kenmore square and fenway park this is great is you are visiting bu or bc but not if you want to be right in the middle of the city center the green line trains are steps away and it is about a half hour ride into the city properor less if you are headed to a red sox game or bc game an ok breakfast was included juice coffee cereal bagels toast etc nothing unusual  the room was quiet but i would suggest you ask to be on the inside away from the street if possible the staff was helpful and accomodating all in all not great but not bad ,0.04047131,0.05532787,neutral,3,3,3,3
awful we found this hotel through a college website it was listed as a hotel in the vicinity of boston college and close to downtown boston we were planning a trip to see the some of the colleges in boston and didn t want to spend a fortune   so we booked it big mistake i knew we were in trouble when we saw it was practically in the parking lot of a gas station   it s just behind the gulf station the check in was fine people were friendly and helpful but when i saw the room i nearly cried it looked dirty the room was dingy and old   really fairly run down the bathroom had a frosted window   no curtain   that looked out on the parking lot if you opened the bathroom window   anyone outside had a full view in we all felt so uncomfortable that we cut our stay down from 2 nights to 1 we just couldn t sleep there it s location is closest to boston college but it was a bit of a trip to boston u and northeastern u what the best western considers a shuttle service is actually the boston subway system this hotel is located on the very outskirts of boston it is in a rather seedy area and we really didn t feel safe waiting for the subway or walking back to the hotel at night it took about 35  45 minutes by subway to get into downtown boston it was not a pleasant ride we loved boston itself  it is a great place to visit my advice is to spend a bit more for a clean bed bathroom and get closer to downtown ,0.031144781,0.038299665,negative,1,0,1,1

awful we booked this hotel because the boston college website listed it as a local place to stay we planned on staying two nights and we had booked two rooms at a rate of 169 00 per night when we arrived my husband commented that it looked like the bates motel once inside our room  we were horrified the room had been decorated in the 70 s and had never been updated it was extremely shabby and the bedspreads and carpet were stained worst of all was the disgusting smell of smoke and stale air it was so bad that we told the front desk clerk that we didn t want to stay there  the clerk informed us that he may have to charge us anyway we told him fine knowing that we would stop our credit card payment and make a formal complaint against the hotel our trip to the boston area ended up lovely we checked into the doubleday suites and were very happy there the rate at this hotel was actually less expensive because a two room suite was 199 00 and accommodated our family just fine the bottom line is don t stay at the best western inn in boston there are so many other options of great places to stay ,0.04205069,0.035714287,negative,1,0,2,1
ok but some cons i stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in october the hotel was very clean seemed to be in a very safe neighborhood and provided an adequate breakfast it was a one block walk from the green line  b branch washington st  however the hotel is rather far from downtown the trolley ride is very very slow and tedious and i found the green b line trains to be the most infrequent as such it usually took us at least 30 minutes to get to downtown in addition on the second night we were kept awake by a loud party from about 2am3am i called the front desk but found them to be extremely unhelpful and completely unconcerned the hotel was the best value that i could find that was still in a decent neighborhood again it was clean and there were no problems with the room itself however due to its inconvenient location and unhelpful staff i will not stay there again ,0.04585799,0.046597634,negative,3,0,2,1
great area not great hotel i ended up getting this hotel through priceline there was a conference in town and i had a hard time finding anything else even through regular reservations overall i was very disappointed to start off my first room had a shower that the wall had been busted out and mold wasv everywhere there was also no kitchen and the hotel lists that every room has a kitchen  it must be saved for priceline customers  i was moved promptly to a room a bit larger with a kitchen and at least it was in tact pros staff was nice unexperienced but nice location was quiet residential and right next to the tcons very dirty the bathroom was infested with house centipedes   i saw a family of them  bathtub did not drain  took about an hour after the shower was finished i asked everyday for it to be fixed but it never was  large groups stay here while the neighborhood is quiet the group can have lots of parties  nonsmoking room smelled of thick smoke i did report my unhappiness to the corporate office and they said i would be contacted by management no one ever contacted me this hotel has potential because of the location but need a complete overhaul ,0.03322072,0.0625,negative,4,1,1,3
not what we expected we booked this hotel because it was very close to boston university where we were dropping our daughter off for graduate school the area was fine     we were able to walk to a grab a bite to eat in the surrounding area without difficulty the free parking was a definite plus our main gripe was with the room which was very very damp it was a warm night but the whole room and even the bed linens felt very humid and damp also the free breakfast was only marginal too many people scurrying for a table and towards the end of the designated hours they stopped putting out more food so all you could have was what was picked over by others we ll be looking for another place to stay when we go back to visit boston ,0.04452055,0.02739726,negative,4,2,1,1

good location with free parking but not a favorite we spent 2 nights at the terrace inn it is located in a very nice area the room was large but we tended to both roll to the center of the bed making it 2 long nights loved the short 3block walk to the mta line for the convenience of taking public transportation especially since the dig collapse had made car travel even more difficult parking was free which is a big plus in boston the ice machine was located about a block away in a different building on our last day it was helpful to be able to leave our luggage in a room off the lobby before being picked up to go to the airport however the staff failed to deliver a message to us from the shuttle service saying they would be 20minutes late even though we were sitting in the lobby reading this caused us some anxiety and an unneeded call to the shuttle service ,0.03794643,0.03125,neutral,4,0,0,2

2 rooms out of 3    not bad the terrace inn is very convenient is well maintained has a reasonable breakfast and is reasonably priced for boston i would have liked to rate this hotel 5 stars but an annoying thing happened when i stayed there recently i made reservations for 3 rooms at this hotel 5 months prior to the date because it was boston university graduation weekend  my wife and i and 2 other relatives were coming up  i called several times over the 5 months to make sure we stil had our 3 rooms each time we were reasured the reservation was there for 3 rooms we got a letter from them stating since it was a busy weekend our deposit was non refundable if we canceled within a few weeks of the date not nice but we accepted that since we were coming for sure we arrived on the day came in at 130 pm they told us they had our 3 rooms reserved but they were not ready yet no problem we would leave our luggage there see the sights of wonderful boston and return after dinner just to be safe i called at 330 pm to see if we needed to do anything else for our 3 room reservation no they said everything was taken care of we had our 3 rooms we returned at 930 pm to be told we had  2 rooms not 3 we overbooked and since you had 3 rooms we thought you could get by with 2 they said nicely  i have no complaints about the weekend night manager he was stuck with the situation he didnt create  all of boston was booked it was late they gave us 20 off each room and gave us two rooms a suite with two rooms the relatives had to share and a room with two single beds for me and my wife the next morning i requested and got an additional room upon checking out i asked the manager how this happened and he said we don t do this on purpose it just sometimes happens that was it you other travellers can tell me if this happens frequently to you  has never happened to me in 49 years i emailed the best western office they said i would hear within a week  haven t heard anything in 1 1 2 weeks from the terrace inn we got by ok for one night it wasn t that big of a deal but my questions are if you can take all my money if i don t show up why can t you make sure everyone who puts that money up has a room have you looked into this mistake to see how often it happens wouldn t it be nice to respond to questions referred from the main officeso i suggest they study the overbook policy or drop that no refund policy on busy weekends if you make reservations you might want to have a cancelable reservation somewhere else just in case ,0.031490386,0.030048076,negative,3,3,3,2

eh stayed here overnight 3 113 12 first the positives close to a t stop about a block awaybrookline area is very nice neighborhood a little out of the way from the tourist area  the price was reasonable  we had adjoining rooms with little kitchenette that we didn t use but that could be helpful relatively clean basic lodgingfree wi fi worked great  free parking the negatives  the bed were hard as stone i didn t sleep well at all even after 2 glasses of wine  small rough bath towels soap that smelled like dial soap  i bring my own soap but dial is really harsh  door handle to our room was loose which made us a little nervous leaving laptops there  a little noisy we could hear the people above us walking around  but not our 2 teenaged girls in the adjoining room  the bagel i got from the breakfast buffet was as hard as the bed we were jokingly calling ourselves barney and betty rubble overall if they changed the beds to something more comfortable and better towrels and toiletries i would stay here again as it is a good budget option for families ,0.04773301,0.03782524,neutral,4,2,4,2

conveniently situated but expensive not having been to boston before i chose this hotel because it was away from downtown but close to a subway station making it easy to get in from this point of view it was a good choice but the hotel was fairly basic for the high price  but boston is expensive other than public transport  the hotel was very busy as it was heavily used by people who were using the close by medical hospital facilities they received a signifacantly discounted rate for which i was contributing to which did not seem quite right reception seemed to be hampered by computer problems but other than that the hotel was efficient clean and the room was as one would expect i e equiped with the normal basics the adjacent food hall was very useful and for a 2 night stay the place was acceptable but nothing more well located for the fenway park red sox baseball ,0.081018515,0.046296295,neutral,4,3,2,4
good location to local hospitals we stayed one night at the inn at longwood due to its close proximately to brigham and women hospital the hotel had a very convenient parking garage attached for 18 a night you need to get your parking ticket validated by the hotel before leaving the check in process was quick and we got to our room within 5 minutes overall the room and bathroom were clean and updated however the ac heat elementvent was dirty and old was from the 1970s complete with dust and grime  this grosses me out at any place the room was very tight for 2 queen beds so one bed was pushed up against the dirty ac thing less then desirable but oh well standard for most older hotels we had dinner at the hotel restaurant the menu was diverse and all price ranges the bartender made some good drinks for us the waitress was extremely slow but the food was good there was a small food court with fast food and coffee shops and cvs the hotel was quiet for a few hours sleep the checkout process was quick and we were at the hospital within 10 minutes i recommend this place if you are traveling from out of town or local and have an early morning appointment at one of the hospitals ,0.04811947,0.030420354,neutral,4,3,3,4
decent place  would recommend this best western is nicer and cleaner than most best westerns initially we had some trouble finding the lobby to check in but only because we went in through the food court cvs entrance at the front desk check in was hassle free but the desk staff wasn t friendly at all he mumbled something about our room having been given away so we had gotten a free upgrade to an apartment suite we were a little confused but hey it was a free upgrade the apartments are in a separate part of the building from the hotel and aren t bad really the hallway once you exit the elevator is a little small and cheap looking and there was a bag of linens  clean or dirty i m not sure sitting in the hallway for the entire duration of our stay  granted we did only stay one night  but once you enter the apartment it is cozy and simply decorated and the kitchen is even outfitted with dishes and paper towels etc there were a few things i noticed which might bother some people but didn t really bother me one is that there were some noticeable holes in one of the walls which just need a little spackle another is that there was a teeny bit of mold mildew in between the shower tiles and the shower curtain could have been a little cleaner other than those small things the apartment was nice and clean enough the hotel itself is only a 6 block walk from fenway and in the same building as a food court cvs also the longwood restaurant on premises is actually pretty good and not expensive i would stay here again if i needed to be in the vicinity of fenway or the hospitals ,0.04464286,0.03733766,negative,3,4,3,3

good bad and the ugly we chose this hotel based on the photo and description on the hotel s own website it was a bit misleading the hotel is difficult to find considering that it sits in top the galleria  not a mall despite the name among several medical facilities and colleges we passed it and had to turn around  a complicated proposition considering the volume of foot traffic in the area the traffic signals are slow and pedestrians  mostly medical school students in a hurry pretty much ignore them creating a major driving hassle we parked in the garage adjacent to the hotel which costs 18 day the spaces are small and some valet service also uses the garage  double parking all over the place creating another headache front desk staff was minimal and we ended up waiting for our parking voucher every time we came and went that s the bad the good the room had a great layout and was spacious it included a table desk microwave fridge sink  basically a small kitchenette  and a whole wall of windows  the windows faced apartment windows which was a bit disconcerting  imagine looking out and seeing a man changing his clothes in his bedroom not 50 feet away  the location was great for walking  much to see and plenty of restaurants to choose from as a matter of fact the galleria food court is literally an elevator ride away there we could choose from a variety of quick meals  mexican chinese american subs sushi soup coffee smoothies even dairy queen and mcdonalds the ugly unfortunately there was an ugly the toilet was unstable and filled inconsistently the shower never stopped dripping and had a slow  extremely slow drain my ten minute shower practically turned into a bath the bathroom sink had a problem with uneven water pressure the lighting in the room was inadequate  four lamps with dim bulbs did not provide enough light and opening the curtains was not much help since the hotel is in the shadows of tall hospital buildings the door was challenging to close and latch and i found the single chain lock  no deadbolt to be insufficient on an odd note the hotel has framed photography on display and for sale in the lobby yet when we inquired about purchasing a piece  which was a fundraiser for the adjacent hospital by the way  no one knew how to sell it to us we left without the piece why display prices and post information about the fundraiser and then be unable to sell the pieces disappointing if i had someone in one of the nearby hospitals this would be my hotel of choice but otherwise i won t be back ,0.03283898,0.054025423,negative,1,1,1,1

beware  bed bugs we were in boston due to a medical emergency we had a very young baby with us so we wanted to be as close to the hospital as possible because we were there for 10 days we had to stay in many different rooms the rooms were mediocre and the price i thought was high even with medical discount we found a couple of the staff great  very helpful went over and above and others totally rude but our biggest problem was bed bugs i was bitten over 100 times on my face  gross   chest arms and hands my adult daughter received fewer bites that became very and infected luckily the baby did not show any bites we are still trying to resolve this situation with the management who has not been overly helpful if you absolutely have to stay here for closeness to the hospitals i would thoroughly check the room for bed bugs make sure you take a flashlight we actually saw two bugs in bathroom but thought they were ticks being from a rural mountainous area this made sense to us until we saw all the bites it is an extremely traumatic event to know that bugs have been feeding all over you in the night both my daughter and myself are suffering from post traumatic stress because of it we are always looking for bugs now and jumping out of bed to check i should say that we had stayed at this hotel before several years ago and had loved it hopefully another hotel chain will build a hotel in this area soon so that people experiencing a medical crisis have a choice be very xareful about your luggage  we are still not sure if we brought any home with us or not ,0.05587255,0.039715685,negative,0,1,1,1

ripping off the medical community and its patients  stay away please note before reading this review that i have stayed at this hotel at least four times in the past year but this last time was for sure the last the front desk staff including the hotel manager is rude they don t give correct information at times and they don t communicate information when changing shifts the night we arrived the hotel s entire computer system crashed we were told not asked to wait in the lobby for over an hour with a 14mo old the hotel manager offered that they have no emergency plan for this type of problem since it never happened before   after an hour we approached the desk and were told that the computer was up but they still couldn t make key cards we waited again for the engineer to come and let us into the room for 5 mins  he tried to open our room using a long wire that he put under the door to hook the door handle on the other side yikes the rug was terribly filthy since after 30 mins of crawling around my son s clean outfit was black not brown from the filth there was an industrial fan on the floor in the hallway outside our room it seems as though there had been a flood in our room since the ceiling was cracked and poorly repaired in the corner perhaps this explains the filthy carpet and hallway fan on a prior visit the heater didn t work the engineer came to fix it and there was a disgusting old baby bottle in there along with actual piles of dust that came out the last time we were at this hotel we vowed never to come again but since children s was paying for the stay we didn t want to look a gift horse in the mouth we now feel that we d rather drive to the hospital from a decent hotel across town than stay at a onestar motel like this again the hotel has a prime location no doubt with many of the hospitals right there i feel they are ripping off the medical community and its patients since they are the only hotel in this area it doesn t seem as though they are putting any money back into the hotel for upkeep modernization or cleaning ,0.026105652,0.033169534,negative,5,0,1,1
totaly awful myself and a friend specifically booked a room with 2 beds when we arrived we were informed that none were available and that they had put us into a room with a single queen sized bed this considering we were two male friends travelling was certainly not acceptable the only option was to pay for a foldout cot to be wheeled into the room the hotel is also connected to a hospital so be prepared for sick people wandering the corridors and constant ambulance sirens outside your bedroom window during the night our room was also never cleaned with dirty mugs and glasses being left unwashed for the entire stay at the end of our stay we noticed a sign which read if we can help with another stay at a best western please ask it happened we were travelling down to new york so asked if they could find out availability in nyc at a best western the concierge told us that he wasn t going to help us and to look up the number in a phone book and do it ourselves from the phone is our room we were then billed for the calls all in all it been one of the worst hotel experiences i have had and would heartily discourage anyone who is considering staying at this hotel ,0.044444446,0.036111113,negative,1,0,1,1

this hotel has only one thing going for it  location this hotel has unattractive small dark standard rooms the windows do not open and the antiquated noisy climate control system can not be regulated well expect blasts of cold air or heat all night long depending on the season no toiletries are provided other than soap and shampoo service was indifferent with the exception of one hospitable cleaning person the reservation for one of our two rooms was lost because our name was spelled incorrectly the reservation confirmations do not have a reference number on them unless you request one fortunately i did so and was able to help retrieve the lost reservation by providing the number three requests to speak with the manager received promises of return calls but no action absolutely no reason to stay here other than its proximity to several major hospitals ,0.06377551,0.05527211,negative,4,0,1,1

mediocre but convenient the hotel is old and in need of a face lift parking is located in a public lot adjacent to the hotel so hotel checkin access and unloading from the garage is awkward parking is 18 per day which is cheap compared to other hotels in the copley square area the double room size is small especially the bathroom and they are stingy with the linens one towel per guest one small pillow etc the service at the front desk is slow but friendly location is definitely convenient to attractions in that part of the city but don t expect a luxury hotel food at the grille is just okay and you have to walk a bit for better food selection ,0.038080648,0.036516126,negative,2,3,4,1
caring hotel my husband and i went to boston for his doctor appointment because something was found he was admitted to the hospital unexpectedly i went to the best western to  get a room but they were sold out  the whole city was full with a convention when i was leaving the concierge told me that sometimes they get cancellations i should check back later he took my name and cell phone number later that afternnon he called and left a message that a room was available but i had to get there quickly if i still wanted it  when i got back to the hotel the concierge left for the day but the front desk had my name when i asked how much it would cost the girl said the medical rate 159 00 i gladly paid and the room was perfect as well as the room service i had when i saw the concierge the next day i thanked him for what he did and the special rate he said that is the rate all patients and their families get no matter what day it is his and the hotel s kindness will never be forgotten ,0.03420398,0.029228855,positive,5,0,5,5

ok hotel good location my wife and i stayed in this hotel for a week while her mother was undergoing surgery in the hospital which was right next door good location the hotel itself was in pretty bad shape the rooms were very small and the elevators were broken the heat was broken during my visit and the lobby was over 100 degrees other than that the staff there were friendly and helpful we ve stayed at 5 star hotels all over the country and we ve never met anyone as spirited and professional as denise at the front desk she is very helpful and made our stay very accommodating it was an absolute pleasure to chat with her everyday if you ever stay at the best western ask denise about all the amazing places to visit in boston although this hotel is mediocre at best our experiences here were phenomenal this hotel would have gotten a 5 star review  ,0.08341875,0.024393748,positive,4,0,3,4

not the best and not a boutique hotel stayed at the capitol hotel as my last stop in australia loved sydney but not this hotel it is a basic three star and the fact that it is owned by rydges is quite surprising definetly not a boutique hotel unless this is the ambition certainly the work and transformation had not started during my stay in july first impression was not good the reception area has a sterile youth hostel feel about it the girl on reception was okay but no aussie welcome during my stay i would say some staff here where polite and friendly while others had little motivation in their job stayed in room 514 which was compact and comfortbale but nothing special bathroom very small and quite tacky location wise no complaints caught the train from the airport to central station which is about a 10  15 minute journey then its just a short walk to the hotel capitol square is right next to the theatre of the same name with a small shopping centre starbucks and irish pub in the same block directly next to china town some of which isn t that picturesque but darling harbour which is brilliant is only a 15 minute walk away circular quay is easy to reach either by taking the train or a ferry from darling harbour which is certainly the most fun way or a good walk down george street never had breakfast in the hotel instead whent along to darling harbour and had great meals sitting in the sunshine in one of the numerous outdoor cafes ,0.06342593,0.054166667,positive,4,0,3,4

compact stayed here for three nights when passing through sydney on business and a tightish budget got a good price through the visitors centre most things about this hotel were just ok the room i had could be described as  compact but no worse than in most major cities room was clean bathroom pretty small  especially the bath  why bother a shower would do in the space available  breakfast adequate i was on the second floor and was alarmed at the noise coming up from the restaurants next door when i exited the lift i suspect the walls are pretty thin between rooms too although luckily i didn t have noisy neighbours and the restaurant noise didn t actually stop me sleeping i recommend the bangkok restaurant next door incidentally  i think i was probably the only nonthai person there which is a pretty good indication of its quality two things annoyed me a lot firstly the high internet charges 50c a minute and i think your usage was capped at an hour in every 24 hours though i didn t carry on using it too long at that price there s also secondly the booklet in the room recommends guests make use of the safety deposit boxes at reception  well they re tiny far too small to get any valuable objects into unless they re paper and can be folded ,0.05116034,0.04799578,negative,0,3,2,2

great time i will admit that i was hesitant to stay at the capitol square hotel after reading some of the negative reviews however being on a tight budget  being near christmas time this was the hotel that offered the best rate in such a great location i had a pleasant checkin and out experience the staff were quite busy on both occasions but they were very welcoming and polite to me and my partner the manager on duty jason i believe his name was explained all the services in detail and answered all of my questions he was also very helpful in letting me know what was around the hotel and what places of interest we could go location was a 5 minute walk to central station china town paddy s markets the qvb and other shopping centres cinemas and if you add another 5 minutes to the walk you re in beautiful darling harbour the room was great considering what i paid the room bed linen and bathroom were clean and comfortable i had a pretty good view of george st and there was very little noise from the city the room included a mini fridge seats cupboard  with extra pillows blankets iron and board kettle mugs tea and coffee  table tv clock radio internet connection and air conditioning the bathroom was substancial including a bath shower toilet sink and all the towels gel and shampoo conditioner i needed it was small but not cramped and i had more than enough room to do what is done in a bathroom overall i am very pleased with my stay and the service provided from the capitol square hotel ,0.0554078,0.03679078,positive,4,0,4,4
great location pity about everything else i have stayed in many different sydney hotels and this time around i searched for a well located hotel within sydney for a reasonable rate for a one night stay just before christmas with a rate of 99 for a sunday night stay in sydney capitol square hotel appeared to fit the bill for this so i was happy to book through the rydges com website upon my arrival at the hotel late on the sunday evening the reception was attended by two staff members one of whom was on the phone the other simply looked up at me blankly and said check in with what name i mean come on it takes only a few seconds more to actually say hello and actually get to know your guest so i was rightly annoyed at this lack of courtesy the same staff member then thrust a registration card at me and simply said can i have your credit card so i can take an imprint why bother employing staff when they do not actually bother to get to know their guestsi was allocated a room on the 5th floor of the hotel and told by the staff member that this was the good floor to be on well if this was the good floor i would really hate to see the other ones the room had splotchy marks all over the carpets dented old furniture and to make things even worse the bathroom was literally the size of a closet and did not have any towels at all so i had to call back downstairs to reception to ask for some towels to be sent up to my room i called twice and on both occasions the number simply rang out on the third attempt my request was finally answered by a staff member who treated my call with contempt and merely stated that they would bring them up when they got a moment i mean i am a paying guest surely my concerns are a priority checking out early on monday morning was certainly very fast i arrived at the reception desk and said that i was checking out the staff member merely said back to me what room and then proceeded to check me out without even a moments pause my request to speak to someone about my stay merely yielded a response of the manager will not be here until 9am and i can t help you i have stayed at many different hotels in sydney and elsewhere and this is the first time that i have actually been told that my opinion is worthless this hotel has a great location at the heart of the entertainment district with darling harbour nearby however the service here is simply appalling and definately not up to the standards of a rydges property throughout my stay i gained the impression that i was simply not important enough to be listened to and that the staff simply do not care as long as you pay up and get out in time next time i am in sydney and paying for my own accommodation i will definately be staying at ibis world square or metro on pitt who i am sure will actually appreciate and enjoy having me as a guest ,0.03445946,0.041216217,negative,4,0,3,1
unprofessional and disorganised my friend and i were only in sydney for one night to go to a concert so we were happy to stay in a budget hotel in a busy area the place wasn too noisy and the location is fantastic a short 5 minute walk to central station and heaps of shops restaurants etc the bathroom and room were clean apart from the doona cover which had urine stains and the carpet which had a large orange stain  not that the carpet matters  however it was the poor service we received when we arrived that turned us off i was called the day before the booking and informed that there was an error with wotif com the website kept taking bookings even though they were full so they were now overbooked the lady was very nice and explained that they arranged accommodation for us across the road at the metro which has the same starrating and amenities and would be the same price for the inconvenience capitol would throw in a complimentary breakfast too we arrived at the metro and waited in line a while and when we got to the desk the staff couldn find our booking about ten minutes was spent waiting in line and then waiting for the staff to go through the system to find us checking with other staff etc then we were told they needed to call the capitol because they couldn find our booking i wasn too happy about all the waiting as we had a tight turnaround time before we had to leave for our concert and we were hoping to get a nanna nap in before we left we waited another ten minutes while the metro staff tried for a while to get through to the captitol  either the phone was busy or noone was answering but we were finally told that the capitol did have a room for us now that inconvenience waiting in line when youe tired hungry and thirsty for no reason whatsoever we got to capitol and waited in line some more we overheard the clerk say to the customers in front of us as they left for their room that they were in the oodside of the hotel meaning away from the street and the roadworks how unprofessional to say that at all admitting that there a good and bad side to a hotel when you pay the same rate and worse in front of other customers we were given our room key and i asked if breakfast was still included in my opinion we been stuffed around more waiting across the road unnecessarily than we would have been if we actually checked in to the metro the clerk checked our paperwork and said that our booking didn include it i explained that we been told we were now getting complimentary breakfast to which the manager told the clerk right in front of us  we weren important enough to be acknowledged that no our booking didn come with breakfast and we weren supposed to go to the metro at all  as if it was our fault we went there  we were told to go to the metro by capitol but they wouldn admit their mistake nor make good on their conciliation for the hassle annoyed i pointed out that they wasted our time about half an hour  meaning no nap  indirectly the clerk then accused us of lying by checking his watch and saying it only been ten minutes since he received the phone call from the metro again they didn seem to grasp the fact that it was their fault we were waiting 20 minutes at the metro not the metros or ours the capitol handling of the issue made us feel completely undervalued a free breakfast is nothing compared to the loss of repeat business from people who stay in sydney cbd regularly so there you have it location good amenities okay service appalling ,0.034836065,0.039120715,negative,4,0,3,1

good budget hotel i had an extended stay at this hotel as i was in sydney for 6 days of business and several more for pleasure i stayed at this hotel as a conferencerecommended hotel and it seems like a fine choice for a budget traveler in response to one of the previous reviews yes the tv seems to be receptiononly  no cable or sat tv but there were a number of stations and as a usexpat living in asia i enjoyed watching letterman and usa morning shows at the wee hours of the morning so the reception and channels were fine enough the location is pretty good you can easily walk to places like darling harbour and hyde park  both about 15 mins walk away  there were many and frequent buses right out at the street that take you directly down to circular quay  5 min bus ride  there are a ton of restaurants in the area especially if you crave asian food  there are plenty of nonasian choices also  there is a major grocery store 2 blocks away and keeping yourself wellstocked was no problem and very convenient i was not a fan of the breakfast the choice is somewhat limited although the setting is bright and cool i only ate breakfast there as it was a convenience on working days the young staff was very friendly and helpful and after so many days i had a lot of contact with them one downside was that some guests seemed to attempt smoking in their rooms  which is not allowed and set off the fire alarm   this happen at least twice and having to evacuate is not a pleasant experience overall it was a pleasant stay while initially i was not sure i could stay for so long in a small room it grew on me and i quickly grew to like it ,0.044367284,0.035108026,positive,5,3,4,4

avoid this terrible hotel    me and a friend had the misfortune of staying at this hotel the location is rubbish  there is nothing of interest nearby there is only one lift for the entire hotel to use which is utterly ridiculous the receptionist is extremely rude  he doesn t even bother to say hello when you greet him when you walk into the hotel the first thing you see is tons of luggage lying around as there is no storage room anyone can walk off with somebody else s suitcase the rooms was very small  the floorboards creak and the reception on the tv was appalling  unwatchable the beds are uncomfortable the hotel was freezing  we had to wrap up before going to have breakfast in the mornings if you want to check in early or check out late  forget it  they charge you astronomical rates  complete ripoff the walls are thin and you hear the people staying in the room next door even the breakfast was mediocre this is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at i would not stay there again if they paid me avoid at all costs you have been warned ,0.027976077,0.049177032,negative,1,0,1,1

perfect mattress a very good hotel when i was looking for a hotel in los angeles the first thing that i wanted was a hotel with a firm mattress and this is what i found there it looked like new the room was also very clean but i think that they should offer free internet access in the rooms  they only have free acess in the lobby and also reduce the price of the valet parking the location is a little far from the main area ,0.061781608,0.021551725,neutral,3,0,3,4

pleasant downtown la hotel i ve had trouble finding hotels in downtown la which are both pleasant and reasonable the kyoto grand while hardly grand fit that billi got a rate of 107 the hotel is located in  really at the edge of little tokyo probably the liveliest area of downtown laone that has restaurants and stores open in the evening at the same time it s only a few blocks from union station and from the downtown core it s a good location for a carfree traveler which i was on this trip it s near the red line subway the gold line light rail and numerous metro and dash buses the hotel s location and its height are its best assets in my view asking for a high floor i was given a 10th floor room which had an unobstructed view facing south  other directions taller buildings might have blocked it  the room was acceptable arguably japanese abstract art on the walls the bed was comfortable enough and there was good natural light in the daytime and darkness at night i didn t have any noise problems there was a decent radiosomething you don t always get as people said the bathroom is smallparticularly annoying was a short bathtub with what felt like a sharp edge at the back when i tried to stretch out in it the bathtub seemed chintzy next to a fairly generous room hotels should have adequate length bathtubs or none at all i didn t try the hotel s restaurantsi went to weller courta 3 story shopping court with multiple restaurants which was literally the next building over the garden didn t really send me but i can see where some people would like it i might stay here again or i might go elsewhere in downtown la if i could get a deal even if those areas are less lively ,0.04711838,0.039719626,positive,4,3,4,3
nickel and dime the hotel itself was nice the room was ok upon entering you got the slight smell of mustiness the carpet had small snags in it and there were no rca connections on the tv to hook up a dvd player there were 2 bottles of water on the table with a 5 price tag on each which would be billed to your room if you drank them which i thought was a joke the shower was missing some caulking around the tub and i think they stopped making that pink shower tile back in the 80 the electronic keys i had for the room only worked after trying each of them numerous times paying 9 95 for internet service per day was ridiculous when you can get it free at all starbucks and best westerns and the daily self parking fee of 24 dollars was a joke even though it is quoted at 22 in the black guest book in the room and to top everything off upon checking out i assumed the price i was quoted and booked online included all fees but i was informed it did not include the daily 13 hotel tax which i had to pay it seems that this hotel is more worried about getting you in the door at a reasonable room rate so they can nickel and dime you into getting a second job not unlike home depot in my opinion if they took as much time paying attention to there guests as they do charging you for any and everything this hotel would be a nicer place to stay not a sermon just a thought ,0.033844765,0.03925993,negative,0,2,2,2

okay   i had stayed here several times when it was still the new otani but this was my visit under the new name management the new otani had been a solid 3star hotel but i had high expectations for this visit perhaps because of the new name  kyoto grand hotel  maybe because of those high expectations i was quite disappointed the hotel lobby is not spectacular but very nice our room however was at a 2star level there were numerous stains on the carpet and the bathroom in particular was quite rundown of course it s all about price value in that regard i feel that it was a good deal based on the 127 night price i got through orbitz i would be very disappointed ath the regular price of 190 to 200 night ,0.058453236,0.04496403,negative,0,0,3,0
rooms were noisy and area was ghetto was in los angeles on vacation with my family of four and found this hotel  back then it was new otani for a reasonable 150 night the room was rather cramped with 2 double beds and the walls were thin the worst part was that because of its downtown location there were many helicopters flying around that made it hard for me to sleep the tea garden sounds nice but in reality is rather small and not exactly a long romantic stroll not much in the area and so like much of la you ll need a car to get around the staples center and koreatown are only a 5 minute drive away and there s a small japanese plaza with a couple restaurants and shops within walking distance i would not recommend unless you got it really cheap ,0.039965987,0.05867347,negative,2,2,2,2

very grand and special i live in la without a car i looked for a hotel near the metro station and art museum i was attending within walking distance this place was a gem three blocks from the metro station and two blocks from the japanese american national museum right in the heart of la s little tokyo formerly the new otani hotel  it still has an asian japanese theme they have about a 20 story tower complete with everything you need a lobby bar which also serves food the weekend bartender roberto g makes the best mojito you could ever have and also is so personable he shold have a tv show  also a lobby level restaurant  azealia for mainly american food a couple floors up are the main eateries a fine food venue with a sushi and shashimi area a place with a lot of beef and asian inspired influences and a mainly nighttime bar with every drink you want including every type of sake as well as food items hours vary depending on the day but there s always something including room service if it s that late plus you re in the heart of little tokyo yeah it might not feel great at 10 or 11 at night but it s safe and there s a ton of other places to eat as well as the inhouse starbuck s but they close early for the hotel itself easy and quick checkin and out very competent staff i never had a problem go unanswered the room i had a basic room was everything you could expect windows that open variable a c bathroom toiletries the tv even includes a few hbo channels my favorite feature was the authentic japanese garden located on a terrace on the third floor it is a several acre oasis garden of foliage streams and a waterfall in one corner there is a full bar and grill where you can walkup or order food to your table grilled ribs and a cool drink while admiring the la skyline in the middle of a japanese garden how cool the hotel s staff was always there not only for security but to make sure you had no problems i never had one ,0.043815788,0.024934212,positive,5,4,4,5

kyoto grand hotel beautiful gardens soso area my family  husband two kids aged 13 and 10 and i stayed here from march 28  31 having booked online directly with the hotel and getting a great internet rate that included parking the hotel is very nice although our room did not appear to be one of the newer renovated ones with the japanese theme it did overlook the gorgeous rooftop gardens the location is close to the disney concert hall but be mindful that unlike many other large cities there is not much happening in downtown los angeles after dark or on the weekends if you are looking for family friendly fast food places and activities you ll have to drive a ways that was not and issue for us as you have to drive everywhere in la anyways the free parking  with unlimited in and out priveledges was a real bonus the restaurants in the hotel were extremely expensive and there did not seem to be too many kid s options again there was a japanese theme to most of them there is a starbucks downstairs so that was our breakfast option the beds and pillows were a little hard but the toiletries were first rate with a lovely mandarin orange scent all in all for a weekend getaway it was a good deal for a nice hotel if you don t mind driving to wherever you have to go ,0.049382716,0.024691358,neutral,3,2,1,3

nice hotel but nothing special although i cannot complain really as the hotel was booked as part of a prize package i won in the uk i feel that some points are quite valid the hotel  is in downtown la mainly in chinatown and the business area it is about 10 miles away from the touristy areas i asked one of the staff where we should go to eat locally and he could not advise but did say to keep away from the missionary area which is not too far away from the hotel i found that a car with a sat nav is a must to get around as i would have found it quite difficult to get around those of a nervous disposition on motorways should stay clear of the freeways as it is bedlam as for the hotel it is classified as a 3 5 star i would give it a 3 star rating as i would have expected more from an american hotel it primarily caters for japanese tourists and business people it is clean but was quite dated the room was also fairly small i would recommend you take some filter coffee and milk with you as we were only supplied one one sachet of coffee aday although when asked they did supply another one we did not eat in any of the a la carte restaurants as it seemed fairly expensive instead opting for the restaurant on the ground floor where the food was adequate but still quite expensive ,0.046875,0.0390625,neutral,4,3,2,3

great hotel stayed here for a 4day girl s weekend and had a great time rooms are clean and decor is great  very la the rooms and bathrooms are also a decent size so there is room for two girl s suitcases shopping etc while still allowing room to move the lobby has a nice sophisticatedbutcomfortable vibe and there are all types who stay here  couples families business travellers and those on trips with friends and there are also pets  we were startled by a beautiful golden retriever when we got off the elevator one morning service is very good overall  attentive friendly and very helpful the concierge paul made some great recommendations for a saturday night out including aoc which we didn t realize until afterwards was such a highlyregarded restaurant he also gave tips on when to arrive at bar marmont so that we could be sure to enjoy the saturday night vibe and miss the line a few small things room service although 24 hour is expensive and the restaurant closes around 10 or 11 so come prepared if you get in on a late flight there is also a very limited night menu  from 11 pm or 12 to 6 am  also seems that there are a fair number of new staff right now they are all trying hard and doing a great job but some of them don t yet have a good knowledge of the area sights and some processes  like an early morning checkout  were a little slow but everyone is keen and friendly  the most important thing this hotel is in a nice area but you do have to walk a bit to get to shopping etc but it s la so to be expected  just about anyone visiting the city should be prepared to rent a car valet parking is 30 day a little pricey but definitely cheaper than the downtown areas of a lot of major cities  san fran ny we didn t look into other parking options so don t know if selfpark is available overall a great stay for two girls looking for a fun weekend ,0.04911924,0.019308943,positive,5,3,3,4

way too expensive for what you get beware the expense does not end with the room charge for a famiy of 4 to sightsee in la we booked this hotel because of its central location my husband is a frequent business traveler la and says that downtown is not safe at night we balked a little at spending more than 300 but figured we d have this super room for the price we got a average sized room with artsy furniture the room was not ready when we arrived and the toilet would not work unless you took off the top of the tank to manually flush it we were shocked at the 30 day parking we made the mistake of ordering a pot of coffee and 4 ojs one morning and couldn t believe the charge was more than 60  in summary it is a nice hotel but i don t think you get what you pay for i ve stayed in much nicer hotels for less i would not go back there unless someone else was paying the bill ,0.026785715,0.0364011,negative,0,0,1,2

nice  modern hotel the hotel palomar is the latest location in the kimpton group s chain of boutique hotels all of the distinctive kimpton touches are there  evening wine reception premium morning coffee very comfortable bed l occitane toiletries great upscale restaurant onsite the westwoodarea hotel is easily accessed on wilshire blvd  which is good since most area restaurants and shops will require a drive  or at least a very long walk  everything looked new which makes sense as the hotel was extensively renovated and has only been open as a palomar for three months the staff seemed friendly and eager but unpolished  i generally don t expect to hear the terms  cool and  awesome being used by the staff during checkin  the rooms seemed somewhat smaller than usual but were clean and included both very nice details  42 flat panel television chaise lounge ample lighting with touch controls and disappointing shortcuts  no hd on the tv cheapish furniture  during my stay i was able to enjoy a dinner at blvd 16 the combination restaurant lounge just off the lobby the food was good the service was very attentive and the atmosphere was festivethe restaurant was still quite busy at 10 at night overall i enjoyed my stay and recommend the palomar particularly if you like your hotel with lots of  attitude  ,0.056914892,0.02925532,positive,4,5,4,4

great hotel    great value i booked this hotel for my last night before flying home from los angeles i stayed at that beverly hills hotel and shutters on the beach before the palomar westwood although the beverly hills hotel is in a different catagory   the palomar was an excellent value and a fine choice for tourists and business people alike i booked the hotel at 189 on a aaa rate which was a great price for a great la location  wilshire blvd  the hotel is older and recently renovated check in was first rate the valet was super friendly and smiling and they knew my name by the time i approached the front desk the staff were really friendly and welcoming my room was a typical sized chain hotel layout but the renovations and decor were really edgy and super comfortable great linens great big screen television desk free wifi and a cool bathroom with stylish sink ammenities of note the hotel offers a free wine hour in the evening which was well attended the lobby is eclectic with a fireplace very comfortable hotel security was visable and reassuring i did not get to the pool or restaurant i want to give kudos to the front desk staff my son and i went to westwood village for a movie and could not find a cab to take us back to the hotel i called the desk and they dispatched a cab to us in just a few minutes when we were checking out they gave us detailed information to get to the orange county airport great job this hotel is great for those who want a great location great service and a reasonable price i will return there when in la the hotel is a welcome addition to the los angeles market and worth a visit ,0.045127794,0.027955271,positive,5,5,5,5
not so great stayed four nights and wasn t terribly impressed rooms are nicely decorated and the bed is comfortable but rooms not overly large and somewhat noisy poor cable without many channels they have large flat screen tv s but analog picture quality and no hd the staff is inconsistent at best turn down serivce occurred the first and last nights but not the middle two the restaurant brought me the wrong order twice at breakfast on the thrid try the eggs were overcooked but i ate them anyway the bar charges 8 drink and doesn t even have nuts or nibbles even for a fee much less complimentary the sole choice is a 12 plate of olives not too tasty with a margarita it has a superficial ecofriendliness but changes the towels daily no matter where you hang them the hallways are kept about 60 degrees and of course the hotel windows don t open the water faucets do not permit you to adjust the rate of flow so it is always full force ,0.039772727,0.06960227,negative,0,1,3,2
a disappointment what a terrible experience new paint carpets and a few pieces of cool furniture can t disguise the inherent shortcomings of this renovated hotel  i am told it used to be a doubetree and that s the level it remains at  the rooms are too small the ac is so loud you want to cover your ears the whole time you are in the room and the walls are so thin that even if you turn yours off you ll hear your neighbor s ac  not to mention their bathroom visits  and don t get me started on the pool tucked away in what feels like an alley behind the hotel  between the hotel s dumpster and the washing facility  with a grand total of five sunbathing chairs  try fighting for one on a saturday afternoon  and a bunch of shared couches half the equipment in the fitness center fails to work properly true the staff are friendly but this boutique hotel is a joke ,0.027142856,0.025714286,negative,1,0,1,5

glad we got the grand opening rate   not worth the regular price my husband and i love kimpton hotels so we were super excited to see this one opening in la right before my sisters wedding so much so that we also had a dozen of our friends and family book here too the hotel is gorgeous and the location is great too we only had breakfast in the restaurant and that was really good our major complaint is with the hotels willingness to problem solve and accommodate guests when a problem does occur our problem had to do with the crib provided for our infant daughter it was not adequete and the hotel s website claimed to have cribs specifically for infants which it did not also the crib was not in our room when we checked in at midnight so it added to the stress of traveling with an infant that late at night when we complained to the hotel staff the person we spoke with said that she was sorry but that she didn t have children so couldn t understand what we were complaining about the gm contacted us as well after we made several attempts to resolve the matter with the hotel staff he clearly had been misinformed because he criticized us for wanting a crib bumper  which we did not want     if we had the time to spend our entire trip playing phone tag in the hopes to connect with someone that was willing to fix the problem we would have but we were there for a wedding and had things to do on a seperate note   i m not sure what the hotel is doing to qualify as eco friendly since the light bulbs in the lamps aren t even the eco friendly variety and the water faucets are the kind that only have temperature control and not volume control overall we were extremely dissapointed with the service of the hotel and would not recommend it to a friend nor would we be likely to stay in another kimpton hotel in the future ,0.033774372,0.037952647,negative,5,1,1,1
a dissenting opinion we booked this hotel prior to its opening and from the information available it appeared to be only a block away from westwood village and fairly close to ucla the hotel is actually at least a 15 minute walk from westwood village it is located in a stretch of highrise condos and apartments on wilshire with not even so much as a coffee shop or convenience store within a close walk unless you get a suite expect a very very small room ours was so small that we did not have room to put up two suitcase stands worse the pillows were rockhard we called down for feather pillows without success and i finally had to go down to search for a couple of softer pillows as for the kimpton amenities the afternoon wine and cheese reception was only wine and little bowls of mixed nuts the morning light breakfast was only tea and coffee with no food of any kind for business travelers beware the kimpton wifi access it is not a secure network all in all it was a complete disappointment we checked out after one night and fled to the downtown omni which was heaven virginia traveler  ,0.036330048,0.036330048,negative,3,2,1,1
fabulous hotel i can t even discount the rating i m giving this hotel based on the air conditioning not working well in the lobby on one of the hottest days of the year i was treated so very well from the moment i entered the doors asked immediately if i would like a glass of wine or other cool beverage i opted for checking in and getting rid of my bag before partaking in the refreshments check in was so friendly and easy he found my name so quickly and asked me if i needed help with my bag the front desk man was so nice he wanted to make sure i got a glass of wine before i headed upstairs i was blown away when i walked into my room i thought there was a mistake because i wasn t just given a room they gave me a suite and it was beautiful  a room with an adjoining living room complete with dining room furniture sweet last surprise  a bottle of champagne chilling in the living room with a card with my name on it sitting next to the bottle the room itself  without the suite was so pretty contemporary and very comfortable great bath products and very quiet ,0.0625,0.046144858,positive,0,5,5,5

disappointing as it was our first time in la we booked a hotel downtown and the omni seemed to fit the bill however we regret that we did not book somewhere hipper and livilier like in west hollywood we quickly learned that downtown is not somewhere that we wanted to walk around in the evening it was all very depressing and souless and felt a bit dangerous the hotel itself was fairly standard the kind of place i like to stay in on business but for pleasure i want something with more character which i have only myself to blame for as i had stayed in the omni before on business and found it efficient however there were other problemswe were very unhappy with valet parking there was an event on in the hotel one evening and we had to wait about 15 minutes on the street to drop our car off     message to hotel if you have an event on you need to get more staff and put your hotel guests first another irritation was that there was no safe in the room we had to desposit our valuables downstairs with the front desk which was inconvenient overall the omni la is a good hotel but definitely not for us ,0.049418606,0.06395349,negative,1,1,1,1
not bad but not great     middle of road hotel for me i recently attended a business conference at the omni thus stayed at the hotel for two nights i booked on expedia with a good rate about 3 months before my stay a few days before arriving i was checking the omni website for wifi access and learned there is a charge of 9 95 day but if you sign up for select guest which is free and create a profile with your likes dislikes you get wifi access for free as well as 2 morning drinks  oj v8 etc     and a daily paper of your choice also if you book with the hotel you can check in online as long as give at least a two hour notice you are coming since i booked on expedia i could not do this on arrival check in was quick you can only valet park which is 26 night i got my requested high floor corner room on the 15th floor with a decent view the room itself is a bit dated the carpet showed signs of wear with stains build up was around the shower door the bathtub had a layer of sediment  or dirt in it but since it was late at night and i knew i would not use it  i used the separate shower  i just put a note the next morning to inform the staff the bathtub was dirty the tv is standard tube tv with a good representation of channels including hbo the honor bar was well stocked and is a traditonal dorm fridge which i like since you can put your own things in it if you want  i just hate the new wave of honor bars that use motion sensors so you can t move anything or put in your own stuff  the big plus was the bed it was very comfortable and pillows large and soft on my first night turndown service was not done turn down service was done for the second night each morning i received two drinks and the la times left at my door which i specificed on the select guest door hanger wifi service in this hotel is very spotty both in my room and during my conference in my room it seemed like i had to sit a certain way in a specific part of the room to get a solid connection anywhere else it would drop for my conference some areas had excellent connection rates while others had none which frustrated several attendees but for me the main focus was on my room and it was terrible although many rave about the location i found it to be the complete opposite there is really not much around the hotel within walking distance i walked a four block radius and saw nothing in terms of good food bars etc   looking out my window i could see the 110 freeway and of course it s a parking lot at 56pm so although i knew i could get somewhere in my car it was not worth the headaches to get it out of valet and fight traffic knowing i could only be out a few hours at most but the hotel bar noe is really nice and they did have a small menu which i had dinner which was decent but pricy check out was quick and easy but i was not honored with a late check out my conference was all day until 5pm and lunch was after the check out time of 1200 having an extra hour would have been nice but i was able to give my suitcase to valet and they put it in my car at the end of day getting my car leave took a bit of time but that was expected since everyone who attended the same conference as me was leaving as well as there were other meeting events ending which made a small bottleneck in getting out of the hotel overall the omni is not a bad hotel only few negatives but the poor wifi and bad location  for me makes me rate it as middle of the road ,0.03282123,0.041375697,neutral,1,0,3,3

nice hotel but a bad experience with valet parking i got a great rate through the hotel website the people checking me in were nice and the room was just fine was glad to have a pool if you re sound sensitive like me though you might notice that you can hear the vibration from mechanical things around the pool under  and for that matter above the water as it seems surrounded by big whirlynoise making things overall i had a fine stay room service was yummy but they didn t follow through on my request to leave it outside my door and i wasn t happy about that biggest bummer was that i was only there 1 night and my car bumper got dinged from the valet parking no response from management despite an attempt to contact them this was my first time at an omni and the car ding and nonresponse leaves a bad taste in my mouth i might not return to this hotel or just park my car myself if i do as for other omnis i d consider it just hope they have their parking better worked out or a manager who is responsive ,0.058125,0.048125,negative,0,0,3,1

excellent hotel i write reviews because i use reviews to select the hotels i stay in this is the first hotel where i give it an almost perfect rating especially for the money it s 5 star all the way on both service and comfort there aren t many restaurants around the hotel  it s in a business district  so the food s a little pricey but it s delicious and the service was great in fact the only suggestion i can give this hotel is to upgrade the toilet paper ,0.0577957,0.025537634,positive,0,4,4,4
 excellent stay in an excellent hotel just returned from a weekend stay at the omni los angeles  california plaza    and i must say that i was hoping for the best but was so pleasantly surprised that this hotel met all my expectations and surpassed them i was traveling with 13 other ladies for a weekend getaway shopping relaxation trip and i was responsible for making the accommodations so i was a little nervous and my hopes were that everyone would be comfortable i am very particular about where i lay my head and i wanted to have the best for our getaway without breaking the bank the omni was magnificent the service was grand the rooms were beautiful with a neutral decor marble baths with separate shower and bathtub large closet space and larger than average room the beds well let s just say that some of us wanted to stay just to sleep in the heavenly bed just one more time the beds are big fluffy with lots of pillows and ultra comfortable the room service was excellent and very timely a few of us ate at the noe restaurant in the hotel on the first night granted it is very pricey but you get what you pay for the service was par excellent and the food was wonderful the swimming pool is a little small and there is no jacuzzi   i did not get an opportunity to visit the spa but the prices were quite high the next day some of us ate in the cafe which was very nice and the food had a really nice flare to it the location was perfect for us as we planned to go shopping at the garment district which was a few blocks away there aren t many places open around the hotel during the weekend but right outside the door of the hotel there is a day spa where some of us went and had manicures and pedicures and there is also a starbuck s that stays open on the weekends in the same area right outside the hotel in a plaza there is nightly entertainment i e bands etc and of course you have the museums and disney concert music hall right near the hotel that is also open on the weekend the hotel is close to the freeways and saturday evening some of us went to the universal city walk for dinner and fun which was about 20 minutes away the hotel has a courtesy town car to take you and pick you up from anywhere within a 3 mile radius the valet was steep at 28 night but there is no other place to park oh well     all in all this is a great place to stay and the only place that i will stay when in downtown los angeles    i have stayied in downtown l a several times in the past and the other hotels cannot hold a candle to the omni    i have already booked another stay with them next month my hat goes off to the omni hotel and staff and a very much deserved thank you for making our weekend so wonderful ,0.05941499,0.024908593,positive,5,5,5,5
excellent room but in downtown la as long as you know that this hotel is in downtown la which is not close to many major tourist spots it s a very good choice we had a good weekend rate and without requesting were upgraded to concierge level including buffet breakfast and happy hour the service and staff were very good the bed was extremely comfortable california king size and the room quite large we had a corner room with two windows  the design of the building is such that there are many more corner rooms than usual it overlooked the plaza where a concert was being held  if you kept the windows closed you wouldn t hear much the windows did open if you liked if you did plan to use the california metro it was just a block away  although i wouldn t recommend it at night if you re not familiar with it ,0.05458861,0.034810126,positive,3,5,5,5

enjoyed our stay at the omni but not sure about its location i booked this hotel because of the recommendations on this website but i did not feel as strongly in its favour as other people had done on arrival by car it was quite difficult to access because of the one way system our room was lovely it was large with excellent amenities although the bathroom was showing its age after checking in we went for a walk to have a look at the surrounding area we walked downhill to the jewellery district and i did not feel safe in this area there were several people sleeping rough on the streets and one was shouting abuse at passing pedestrians i was glad to get back to the hotel and considered moving to another hotel the next night on a plus side the hotel is very handy for the theatres  they are in the opposite direction and we went to see jersey boys which was excellent we found the staff very pleasant and the buffet breakfast was excellent we also had a meal in noe restaurant and this was excellent the hotel is at california plaza and there is an area where open air concerts take place this is very enjoyable and many locals come along to enjoy the music if this hotel had been situated in a different area i would have enjoyed it more but i did not feel comfortable venturing far from the hotel particularly at night ,0.058266934,0.03984064,positive,4,5,4,5
a nice hotel i stayed at the omni for one night for business in july 2007 and i definitely had a pleasant stay i booked my hotel online and in the special requests section i asked for a room on a higher floor and i was pleasantly surprised to see that the hotel actually read my request and honored it  so many do not   the room was clean and nice but not incredible the fitness center is small but nice with new stateoftheart equipment  not a lot of it but enough for an ok workout and right next to a spa that looked quite nice  although i didn t get a chance to use it  the restaurant offered healthy and organic options for its breakfast buffet which was nice to see the location is good if you need to be downtown close to many downtown attractions overall i would have no problem recommending this hotel to others my one complaint which i have with so many hotels is that it charged extra for internet access in the room which is particularly nonsensical given the fact that there s free wifi access in the lobby ,0.063125,0.026875,positive,0,4,4,5
a disappointment there is a lot of potential here the building is well located within walking distance of the arts institutions on bunker hill and most of the office buildings in downtown la the public spaces inside the hotel and in neighboring california plaza are attractive but there is a real sense of fatigue the facilities need renovation and the staff seem disengaged my room was spacious but had all sorts of problems for example hot water in the shower was very slow  like 2 minutes  to appear and the pressure was never strong the air conditioning was weak there was no light next to the reading chair and the carpet was old stained and ugly food in the daytime restaurant was really bad tough and tasteless  i didn t sample the upscale evening restaurant noe  and everywhere  the doormen the checkin people at the desk the attendant in the conciergelevel lounge  the staff were indifferent lots of smiles but no results i am sorry to say this i have stayed here before and things seemed better then that s why i returned it is still an ok hotel but no more than ok if what i experienced on my recent trip is typical one can do better elsewhere ,0.047093023,0.040697675,neutral,5,2,3,3
convenient getaway for those of us in the o c stayed at the omni los angeles for a quick weekend getaway from june 29 to july 1 2007 took advantage of a 119 per night weekend rate to celebrate our 23rd wedding anniversary  checkin checkout the quickest most efficient i ve ever experienced anywhere in the world checkin was online a few days before our arrival our key etc was in an envelope ready for us to pick up from a predetermined area the moment we stepped into the hotel we practically didn t stop from the front door to the elevator checkout was just as efficientdropoff box for the keys bill already paid our package included parking which saved us 28 per night the hotel inadvertently charged us for the two nights we stayed but they promptly reimbursed us with no hassles when we pointed out the mistake we appreciated this very much  service friendly always wellmeaning staff who ocassionally lacked attention to detail but attended to us quickly and efficiently  perks the hotel surprised us by upgrading us to club level which included an expanded continental breakfast cocktail hour and a relaxing lounge with nice views from the 17th floor additionally the hotel surprised us with a handtyped note acknowledging our anniversary and left us a 45 bottle of champagne and chocolatecovered strawberries on our first night nice touches  transportation we had our own car but didn t use it since we hung around the vicinity of the hotel the entire time the omni offers their town car for transport to any site within a three mile radius of the hotelvery convenient we used a combination of walking  difficult at times because places are widespread or not easily accessible because of overpasses underpasses and steep inclines  the towncar and a taxi  once   exercise room and pool averagegets the job done some of the equipment needed repair hallway to this area is somewhat dreary  spa had an ultimate facial which included a hand foot and shoulder area massage average for the 150  with tip fee my usual facial back home is 60  with tip and is much superior in quality  gift shop was under rennovation needed lip balm which the front desk sold to me for 2  room clean somewhat dated  early 1990s and well kempt smallish window with a decent view on the 16th floor  neighborhood except for the california plaza  where the omni is located  the downtown area is not an easy walk the disney music hall and gift shop moca  museum of modern art and its gift shop and the l a music center however are easily accessible on foot we ve been to many big cities around the world and the only people wandering the streets in l a seem to be a few homeless the throngs of tourists and locals were mostly absentsomething were not used tosince the presence of many people is the usual when visiting other big cities this downtown area is relatively clean  entertainment expect a quiet downtown  on the weekends at least and a lowkey night life fortunately the l a film festival featured a documentary film at the california plaza saturday night so we spontaneously attended this event and participated in the discussion with the director of the film and one of the key historical figures from the film afterward very cool tips check out any specials and packages directly on omni s website  at the club level eat breakfast as early as possible it gets crowded 45minutes after they begin serving  reserve for dinner excursions and activities before arriving at the omni it makes your weekend getaway run more smoothly and efficiently  suggested activities watch a play  which is what we did  listen to a concert or take in one of several cultural experiences offered check out local listings for nearby events overall an excellent value for the money happy travels ,0.0353461,0.024484536,positive,4,4,5,5

great deal we stayed at the omni for four nights during a recent vacation to los angeles it was hard to get a good look at the outside of the hotel because we were never standing that far back inside i enjoyed the modern asian inspired flower arrangements we found the hotel to be located centrally to the things we wanted to do driving to the j paul getty museum a trip to the griffith observatory walking to the fashion district and dining in beverly hills the staff was courteous upon our arrival and we were efficiently checked into our room i was a bit nervous because we had a voucher purchased through a discount travel company listed on tripadvisor there were no problems and it turned out it was just a really good deal the hotel is located across from the moca and within the california plaza we wandered the plaza and found the nearby water features to be very nice a great spot to sit in the morning with coffee in general the area was nice although if walking there is an underpass i would suggest you skip walking under i was surprised to see so many people walking in la i didn encounter any maintenance issues and the room was always made up before we returned for the day the options for the minibar were numerous and predictably expensive the bed while made up with layers of padding and soft sheets was so warn i didn sleep well many nights all the padding over the mattress seemed to trap the heat and even with the air conditioning on cold the bed was too hot this seems to be a common effect of the padding hotels are adding to their bedding the complimentary toiletries were nice and the towels thick and absorbent the tile on the floor of the shower was a sad small pale pink tile but overall the bathroom was nice the counter had enough space the lighting was bright enough and they even had a makeup mirror the one thing i missed was a light in the closet it was difficult to see my clothes after hanging them away we didn use the restaurant or the room service we usually had coffee in the room before heading out for the day we did use the complementary wireless internet and the valet parking i have no complaints with either we didn turn on the tv so i have no comment on that the view was okay we overlooked some modern art in the plaza below the fitness room was very nice it was equipped with elliptical trainers treadmills and stationary bikes for aerobic training the also had cybex machines and free weights for weight lifting they had towels water and headsets freely available in the room a couple of the elliptical machines had tv monitors and there was a large plasma screen tv in the room i noticed the lap pool outside the fitness room but didn give it a try all in all we had an enjoyable stay and wouldn hesitate to visit the omni again ,0.04390595,0.034548946,positive,0,0,4,4

great value loved the room this is a great hotel i really loved the room it had a huge comfortable bed and was newly renovated the bathroom was beautiful and big we had a wonderful view of the moca too got a great rate for the hotel through another website  i e not the hotel website and paid only 89 per night as we stayed during a quiet time and most tourists during christmas tend to go to anaheim resorts there were very few guests and i think this is why we got such a great rate you have to drive in la so the location suited us even though it was downtown the location didn t matter too much because we had a car there weren t a lot of eating places nearby you have to either eat at the hotel or walk a little to find somewhere to eat as a tip don t park outside of the hotel because it may not be safe for you or your car if you do yes valet parking was pretty expensive at about 25 a day but an unavoidable expense if you have a car ,0.03125,0.034438774,positive,3,4,3,5
the omni gives respite from hustle and bustle we stayed on the ninth floor of this clean and quiet hotel rooms were a bit impersonal  as others have said but that was easily remedied by fresh flowers purchased at the nearby farmers market and a vase from room service we were going to the house insititute on this visit and we were pleased that the hotel has a free car service to take you to nearby locations and pick you up when you are finished at no charge there are several coffee shops right outside the hotel so we were able to just dart out for coffee in the morning and save the roomservice fee  although i found out later that if you are a member of the omni guest club as i am coffee is free  we ate at the resturant at the hotel and had an amazing meal this was a great homebase from which to explore los angeles especially if you prefer a quiet zone at the end of a busy day if you want to be an la scenester go elsewhere ,0.031914894,0.021941489,positive,5,5,5,5
quality hotel i m often surprised at how overgenerous trip advisor reviews can be of some fairly ordinary hotels  hilgard house is rated way too high for example nice people and location but the rooms are 70 s relics but i would strongly disagree with the last very negative review of the omni los angeles this is a very high quality comfortable hotel i have stayed several times mostly for business both in ordinary rooms and at the club level and would rate all of those stays very highly service is not perfect but very professional and welcoming like all omni s the bathrooms are a bit larger with a separate bath and shower and countertops the bed with down comforter and mulitple down pillows was very nice comfortable and clean  not the typical ugly mulitcolored polyesterish and probablynotwashedinquiteawhile comforter i stayed 4 nights on the 16th floor club level  i had a good sized corner room with a direct view of the music center the disney hall city hall the museum of contemporary art and alas the large notsointeresting condominium building across the street there isn t a large amount of public space in the omni but what it is has is attractive downtown la while getting better can be hit and miss in terms of nightlife but the omni is quite central for downtown business activities and culture as has been often mentioned music theater art little tokyo etc are either next door or down the street the morning breakfast and afternoon snacks are good in the club room which also has 2 computer terminals and a color printer the people staffing the club room are very nice and very hardworking since they pour drinks help out with the computers clean up etc wireless internet access is also free for select guest members  which you can just join when you arrive if you want  in addition to coffee tea etc delivered each morning for select guests some small service issues  they delivered the wrong paper in the mornings but when i went to breakfast the wsj nyt and lat were all available so no big deal coffee was delivered to my door half of the days but again i went to breakfast each morning anyway so i didn t even bother to call and it was free most of the front desk personnel were good parking valets were very good i ve stayed at several of the downtown hotels  bonaventure biltmore new otani the grand etc  but the omni is my preferred hotel quieter nicer rooms more valets for parking and overall a higher quality hotel ,0.052690584,0.03643498,positive,5,5,5,5

pricey but very nice we booked ten rooms for my staff for a thursday friday stay in early november due to a city wide convention and laker game downtown was virtually sold out we found concierge floor rooms for 259 the hotel is a few miles from the convention center but is directly across from the disney concert hall  some of the rooms have a great view of the hall the bellmen were very helpful and quick at this hotel we used car or cab servcie every day and one nice bellman made sure we knew the flat fee or expected rate so the cab couldn t overcharge us the lobby is small and centers around a strange glass atrium filled with a yellow iron sculpture resembling an animal the orchids filling the vases at every turn are nice the front desk is small but there was no line there was a mixup with my reservation at first but it was quickly fixed the clerk did not remember to inform me about the concierge lounge however my room was a good size with a great king bed lots of pillows a chair with ottoman and a desk the furnishing looked update and almost new and the bedding was very nice the tv was large but not a newer model there was an open plug available  not under the bed for electronics and a nice cd player alarm clock the robes were nice albeit huge there is a minibar with pricey but attractive items like chocolates nuts spa products even a cute little quote book and spray starch for your clothes  3 95  there is an iron and ironing board in the room which is nice although free pressing was included at the concierge level they needed about 24 hours to complete it i liked the bathroom which had a separate bath and shower and lovely toiletries the towels were plentiful and plush and there were two bath mats provided which was nice the marble vanity was a bit small for a woman s things but there were a few tiny glass shelves and a nice magnifying mirror  you must stand to reach it  lighting is good and there is a scale    in the bathroom water pressure was good and the bath shower temp was nice  i liked the bath salts that were provided  but the sink wouldn t run hot water at all there was also an interesting switch so you could listen to the tv in the bath without blasting it from the bedroom but it didn t work consistently enough to be of much use while it wasn t too hot or cold i would have like my ac to work just a bit better  even if you set it for 60 degrees it wouldn t go below 70 room service was prompt but extremely expensive  20 room service fee plus 2 50 delivery fee  as is the onsite restaurant  noe food was nicely done and hot on arrival with everything that i requested there is a bar lounge where you can order the room service menu but it really isn t much of a hotel restaurant and is hard to find on the third floor there are small couches and tables in the hallway near the lounge if you have a group there is a tiny tiny gift shop at the back of the third floor don t rely on this for much more than a soda snack or magazine but the prices were fair the concierge lounge is on the 17th floor and you must use your room card to access that floor the breakfast spread was much more than i expected  eggs sausage oatmeal pastries fruit and there is an internet alcove available for use the huge plasma screen tv was a nice touch one warning about the view from the hotel  there is an apartment building across the street and i noticed lots of tenants  men who stood on their balconies at night taking in the view of the hotel also the window jutts out from the building  nice almost like a balcony but if you look right or left you can see anyone standing in their window and they can see you i found the hotel comfortable and somewhat quiet i wouldn t hesitate to stay here again if i had business in the area but i think you can find more reasonably priced hotels if you just want to stay in downtown ,0.049089726,0.028283484,positive,4,5,3,4
less than expected after reading the great reviews of this hotel i decided to stay at here this weekend with my daughter for a shopping trip i booked the hotel via their website and used the 50 off coupon that was included with my select guest card package last year when i arrived at the hotel i was informed by the young desk clerk that i would not receive the parking  26 a night that was included in my 149 rate because i was using the discount then he stated i could not use the upgrade certificate with the discount either i then asked to speak with the manager instead he must have tried to confirm this himself as when he returned he told me that i could use the upgrade certificate    but from my experience this hotel doesn t really have upgraded rooms other than the club floor which he refused to put us in unless i paid an extra 35 a night i had already read on here of that upgrade being given for free and i declined upon opening the door of our room on the 14th floor i noticed we were given a good size room with a king size bed  when i had reserved 2 double beds non smoking then we were moved to another room on the same floor this time a standard double room i called downstairs and asked the manager why this room was considered an upgrade and she said it wasn t so she moved us one more time wait it get s better    on saturday after a trip to the fashion district we called the hotel for the town car to pick us up and only after 5 phone calls several promises that the driver was on his way   1 hour later he finally made it i don t know if i would ever depend on that service again anyway when we returned to our room it had a very strong odor of cigarette smoke apparently one of our neighbors decided to light up and the smoke entered our room through the vents my daughter called the front desk and they suggested that we move   again same thing occured here they moved us to a standard double instead of larger room and we have to move for the last time to the 6th floor that is 5 rooms total i have never had such an experience and hope to never have it again i stayed here because it looked like they excelled in service but i found the opposite to be true none of our preferences for the select guest program were fulfilled so i really am not sure why the program exists ,0.028494624,0.043010753,negative,0,0,1,1
okay but not what i expected i read many reviews about the omni hotel los angeles and most had nothing but great things to say about this property perhaps my expectations were set too high because my experience did not mirror that which others encountered here are the issues i found hotel staff not at all knowledeable about the area around the hotel  e g  restaurants parking issues etc and they appeared minimally interested in helping me out the rooms were adequate but nothing spectacular as i had expected from other reviews the pool area had no spa and the towels were not kept stocked adequately during my stay one major issue i must make all aware of parking is a joke very expensive 26 00 a day  valet and if your into tipping everytime you have to get your car then well hats off to you  i m not into that and it was quite costly during my stay parking around the hotel is not recommended due to the reported car thefts and burglaries in the area by hotel staff i also didn t see any security on site at the hotel during my stay  at least they were not visible  overall the hotel is adequate but nothing remarkable and in my opinion this is not a 4 star property ,0.04735683,0.052863438,negative,2,0,1,3
ok but nothing spectacular i just got back from a trip to la and stayed in both santa monica and the omni in downtown la i booked the omni based on the reviews here and on a great deal  150 a night  whilst i was very happy with the hotel i didn t experience any of the wow factors that other reviewers have reception staff were perfectly pleasant but not exceptionally so and in the two days i was there there was never once an occasion where the doorman opened the door for me  even when i came back laden with shopping bags it seemed that they were focusing on the rich american families and business guests rather than the lone female traveller  i wondered if they thought i was less likely to tip the room was comfortable  and an enormous king size bed  but no hairdryer  the area is very quiet and didn t feel particularly safe the metro is only a block away but you have to walk through an area populated by homeless people to get there ok  if a little smelly during the day but certainly made me nervous of doing so at night in summary if you need a comfortable room to rest your head a good deal if you want to be in the action or want a hairdryer try elsewhere  ,0.036702126,0.04680851,neutral,3,0,4,3

wonderful hotel all the reviews were spot on with this place an amazing bargain for a magnificent hotel the rooms were lovely and the beds supremely comfortable and with a large bathroom and separated shower and bath the gym had good sufficient equipment the staff were very helpful and welcoming and very patient we used the car valet service a little pricey at 26 per day but the car was got promptly on request and the hotel entrance smelt wonderful with all the lovely fresh orchids the hotel is in downtown la and is a 10 min walk from the nearest metro station pershing square though it s a sharp uphill to get back to the hotel from the metro the general area is fine a lot of homeless people near the metro and park and not a lot to do or eat in the area on a weekend as it s a business area and the hotel resturant is a little pricey but more than exceeded expectations ,0.06026786,0.029017856,positive,3,4,4,5
superb service booked a 4 star hotel on hotwire and got the omni hotel in the california plaza  one of two 4 downtown lax hotels  the other is hilton checkers which is excellent too at a fantastically low rate of under 80 night for the weekend   but it turned out my reservation was accidentally booked for march  same days and dates as feb  at checkin i had basically no reservation but the manager and front desk agent went out of their way to call hotwire and change the dates amazingly my reservation was switched with no problem and surcharge at all the service rendered and received was without question above and beyond what i d expected esp with the discounted rate i d booked the room in fact the day manager and lara the front desk agent made me feel very at home and at ease by suggesting that if i was hungry that i could go for lunch in the california plaza while she was on hold i was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy while my problem was being resolved room 920 was designed for the physically challenged and therefore quite spacious  large door openings and plenty of room to move about room very well appointed large tv fully stocked mini bar and snacks if you woke up hungry bathroom very clean with bathsheet towels and the king size bed very very comfortable used the 49 cents minute computer in the business center to print boarding passes but the very slow connection kept timing out and ended up wasting 11 minutes but this inconvenience would not deter me from staying at the omni again i love the location as it is close to the music center  dorothy chandler ahmanson and mark taper forum theatres  the reason for my visit and requirement for a downtown hotel the walt disney concert hall many museums and very close to little tokyo for great authentic and busy japanese restaurants however during the nights this business district becomes quite deserted and the homeless aspect is quite prevalent a complimentary car service is provided within a 3 mile radius which i would have used if i had not already bought a day bus pass overall i was more than impressed with the omni  superior customer service and a thoroughly pleasant 2 night stay ,0.0469375,0.044,positive,4,0,5,5
i m definitely going back we arrived at the omni at california plaza and were impressed it s a really nice looking hotel and the concierge quickly offered to bring our luggage up to our rooms for four women you know we didn t pack light excellent guest service check in was quick for halloween weekend our room was nice and clean the size was enough for two girls and all of our stuff the shower pressure was great comparable to a waterfall there is a built in speaker in the bathroom so that you can hear the television i slept well in the comfortable bed the cleaning ladies came while i was still asleep and did not stop knocking until i opened the door that was probably the only negative thing yes the room food is expensive so it s up to you there weren t any rowdy guests and that s always a plus our first day there we parked in a lot on the corner behind the hotel since it was cheaper but ended up walking for about 10 minutes dragging our luggage around downtown so i suggest using valet it s more convenient i would stay here again because it s a quiet area not far from shopping and nightlife and the guest service is excellent ,0.054545455,0.0375,positive,4,0,4,5
mixed feelings stayed there over a long weekend  nov 1013 was attending a convention at the convention center which is in an absolutely dismal part of downtown there are only terrible hotels within walking distance  hotel figueroa holiday inn the omni is roughly a mile and a quarter away but not a bad walk it really tries to be a first class hotel in terms of services but it fallsa bit short example we asked the concierge about local restaurants they reccommmended in alvarado by the train station in a touristy area ok  the food was terrible and it was a rip off but thats not why i was pissed they provided us with a free town car ride to the place but when we called back they told us it would be at least 45 minutes to pick us up i would still of not been mad  except it is very difficult to find cabs in la we had to walk over to the train station and only out of providence was there one there they did apologize and reimbursed us for the cab i guess my beef is that they should of warned us they might not be able to pick us up instead of putting us in a dangerous situation and i would of gone to a more touristy area  chinatown where they have more cabs otherwise the hotel was fine i guess my real beef is with la its just not tourist friendly at all its too spread out and you definitely need a car  ,0.03503788,0.05587121,negative,1,1,1,1
eat before you go i was expecting better given that this is a top chain but was disappointed the room was small as was the bathroom the hotel restaurant served typical la cuisine which means if you re a redblooded meat and potatoes type you ll go hungry on the plus side the pressure in the shower was awesome and the room service breakfast was good the hotel valet staff was very helpful as i needed to navigate downtown to get a few things i had left at home however they let mark garagos the attorney who respresented the evil scott peterson park his car there as his office is next door seeing him unexpectedly was a little like running into hitler or satan okay maybe that s a bit dramatic  but it was unsettling all in all this omni wasn t the great hotel i thought it was going to be ,0.04901961,0.031862747,negative,1,1,1,1

happy we stayed at the omni in downtown la the last week in may 05 room was fine clean roomy with a view  if we turned our heads  of frank gehry s disney center what was probably the most impressive was the lowerlevel personnel maids bellmen and the guys working the driveway all cheerful friendly helpful it was quite striking the hotel has a car service that s available from 7 a m until 11 p m to take you or pick you up within a 3mile radius  that means you can go to dodger stadium for instance  no reservations first come first served but it worked really well we had a car but used the service 3 times in 5 days and was happy with it the hotel is walking distance of the disney mark taper forum and chandler pavillion as well as being almost on top of the contemporary art museum there aren t a lot of restaurants particularly for breakfast nearby especially on weekends but we walked down the hill to the central market and had a wide range of choices including great mexican food  used the car service for a return  if you go to the market go across the street on the downhill side and see the bradbury building unremarkable outside but amazing inside by the way there are refrigerators in the rooms for the minibar and they can be used if someone needs to store medications  no need to ask for another i don t recall the daily parking charge but it wasn t as much as some previous reviewers said ,0.04060219,0.017335767,neutral,3,0,4,4

a nice but quirky hotel while there are a lot of positives about this hotel a few things stood out as quirky first the window blinds are such that they can t be fully closed at night so a tremendous amount of light comes in if your top priority in staying at a hotel is to get a good night s sleep this is certainly a strange disincentive second the angel s flight lounge is rather hard to find and if i remember right it closes relatively early  although not as early as the restaurants and lounge at the biltmore down the hill  third there s not much life in the hotel the lobby seems to be relatively deserted at all hours except for the occasional tourist trying to rent a car i stayed there three nights and there was never a point where the hotel seemed to be either crowded or busy on the positive side the rooms are a nice size with large bathrooms extremely clean and well maintained and there s not much traffic noise from the street below  this hotel is built on top of a downtown hill  i would rather stay here then at the bonaventure hyatt regency biltmore or the new otani downtown and i hope to stay there again on a future business trip however if you want a quotient of fun in your stay this may not be the best choice all in all this is an above average utilitarian hotel  a trait it seems to share with the bonaventure and the otani  which may not be everyone s perfect cup of tea ,0.046028882,0.04873646,neutral,2,0,3,3
poor service i went to the omni after i read all of the great reviews posted on this site personally the hotel was nice but i thought the service was very poor and rude the restaurant  bar was nice but again the service was terrible we waited for 20 mins to get service  and that is only because we went to the bar 3 times to remind them we were waiting each time they kept saying someone was coming   we finally left and ordered room service service is everything to me   i will not be going back to the omni next time i m in los angeles ,0.03318584,0.05641593,negative,0,0,0,1

sure recommend it  but be aware  i stayed for one sat night with my bf and i occasional traveller say you ll have a present stay at omni my bf who is a re developer also a frequest traveller says high quality  good service along with other comments i d like to add five things about omni 1 if you go there at night it s hard to find  do not go thru the tunnel  2 around the hotel there aren t many homeless so that you can take a little morning walk to check out a latino market near the hotel they have eateries cafes vegetables  meat shops on the way back you can come back in the hotel from 2nd floor where you see other shops  sorry i can t explain exactly how or where  3 drinks  snacks in the room are costly  like other hotels  e g  mm for 4   50 or less at sfwy  4 there re some fruit you can enjoy near the front desk in the exercise room five if you register for special membership want your complimentary drink let them know or won t get it have a nice trip oh did i mention we paid under 100 with parking  24  ,0.04799107,0.043526787,positive,4,0,4,5

beautiful hotel lousy service when we first arrive we were greeted by the valet people they took the car as we went in after getting our hotel room we decided to go out on the town however when we went to get our car they informed us that we have been charged  24 we weren t told of the charges before hand so this had came as a surprise to us where we are from it is unheard of to have parking fees that high we were then told that we where going to be charged 24 for every day that we were there and that we couldn t park anywhere else not wanting to spend an extra 100 dollars just on parking we decided to park at a near by parking lot and walk when we asked to have the charges removed from our bill because we no longer needed the valet parking they rudly ask us many questions and after waiting 15 minutes they finally took off all charges along with taking off the charges they also closed our account so we could no longer buy items  like a prepay movie  we had also asked for directions to a place but somehow they guided us the wrong way we ended up in a mass confuesion trying to find our way to our destination the hotel is also by a very low part of town from many window views one could see homeless people laying about however the hotel is very beautifully decorated and the rest of the staff was happy to accomidate us  i will be staying at a different hotel in a different side of the town hopefully this review is helpfull to anyone that is considering staying at the biltmore ,0.038590603,0.03942953,negative,1,0,1,1
not a pleasant experience i would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy this hotel is the thing that nightmares are made of the location is terrible  it is located in a dangerous part of town and incredibly hard to find the beauty of the hotel itself ends in the lobby  the rooms are small and not clean the staff is rude and unbearable and the hotel itself has a bad smell to it instead of treating their guests as paying customers and in a friendly and helpful way  the employees at this hotel treat their guests as though they should not have any requests or questions and should stay out of their way the staff is pretentious and does not make their guests feel welcome this hotel is not worth the price i will never return to this hotel ,0.038194444,0.06944445,negative,1,0,1,1
things not always better the second time around my husband and i stayed at this hotel in 2001 and had such a wonderful time we promised ourselves we would go back well we wish we hadn t kept our promise when we arrived the front desk peronnel wasn t as friendly as the last time in fact they weren t helpful at all it was the bellhop who was sooooooooo nice without asking he told us everything about la and what we could do and where we could go he also told us about the hotel amenities he was very informative we stayed on the 10th floor which is the club level we were told at check in that the rooms had been renovated and we would be very happy with ours oh my if our room had been renovated i would hate to see the rest the 10th floor smelled old and musty our room and bathroom were dirty the walls looked patched up and the shower head was disgusting and looked like it hadn t been cleaned since it was first installed when i sat on the bed it felt hard as a rock so i called down to housekeeping to ask for a bed pad the lady told me she didn t think they had pads and i should call the front desk and ask to be moved since most of the mattresses had been replaced in the last year but our mattress was one of the ones that hadn t so i called down to front desk who said they would check on it for me when front desk called back she rudely informed me the mattresses on our floor hadn t been replaced and there was nothing she could do she said she would send housekeeping up to put a pad on the bed they did but i had to jump thru hoops to get it because we stayed on the club level we had evening snacks and continental breakfast wow   that was definitely worth the upgrade the breakfast was delicious and plentiful with fresh pastries scrambled eggs bacon sausage fresh oj and the freshest sweetest mix of berries i ve ever eaten we ate at sai sai the onsite japanese restaurant we had eaten there before and had a wonderful experience not so this time the waitress handed us our menus and returned about 3 minutes later  no exaggeration and asked us if we had made up our minds when we told her we needed more time she became irritated she hovered over us  without being helpful the whole time and we felt like we shouldn t be there it was very uncomfortable and then our food arrived cold the 10th floor concierge was definitely much more helpful and friendly than the lobby staff the gentleman manning the concierge desk spent a considerable amount of time showing us maps of la and telling us where to go and where to eat we followed most of his suggestions and weren t disappointed check out was a different story the valet staff must have been in a bad mood because they were rude to everyone people were complaining to management and staff it was sad i m not sure what happened at this hotel in the last few years but our stay at the biltmore was a big disappointment for us and we won t be back i ve stayed at some old hotels that have updated their facilities without losing their historical charm unfortunately the biltmore isn t one of those places i also hope the front desk and valet staff remembers that they represent the hotel and should seek some friendly advice from the bellhops ,0.0272,0.0348,negative,3,1,1,1
horrible service we stayed at the hotel for a wedding prior to our arrival i called and confirmed our reservation for a nonsmoking king size bed when we got to the hotel they stated they only had two nonsmoking rooms  queen size and double size beds so we opted for the nonsmoking queen size bed the room was small old smelley dusty and the lights were not working our request for the second room was met with rude commentary and poor service the second was much better than the first room but more inline with a one or two star hotel it was not a fourstar hotel other guests that were attending the wedding also stayed at the hotel and had similar experiences we were all very disappointed with the cleanliness of the rooms service at the front desk and valet we would not stay there again ,0.03125,0.052364863,negative,0,0,0,1

never again my stay here was for 4 nights 48 january  05 i was staying with family and i have to say it was one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever had upon check in the reception staff was rude and very distant when i noted that i had requested a high floor room i was told that i would be on the 4th floor and that was that once in our room which to give it credit was a decent size we realised that the closet was tiny and the room smelled old i understand that this is an historic hotel but not having the ability to open windows and allow fresh air in is ridiculous on the first time using the shower i opened the shower curtain to find the bathroom had flooded i called down to report it to the main desk they sent an engineer who had no idea what i was talking about not sure what was done to stop the problem it looked liked they regrouted the bath but the bathroom flooded again everytime it was used in the end it seemed as though the double layer shower curtain was leaking there was a fridge in our room which we didn t have to pay for good thing too considering when i went to use it i found old food from the previous guests inside who knows how long it had been there i know they have housekeeping but somehow they seemed to have forgotten our room only when i dropped a piece of clothing on the floor i found it covered in dust that was when i realised that they only vacuumed the areas on show continuing with the service received in this hotel upon check out they did not disappoint i was ignored for around 10 minutes until i approached the desk and announced my wish to leave the lack of attention and eye contact from staff made my exit from this hotel something that could not have come too soon ,0.028508771,0.044590645,negative,0,0,1,1
make sure they don t shut the water off when you re about to check out   we stayed here in november 2003 and have been meaning to write this review since then we were really looking forward to staying in this hotel after reading about its history and the location what a disappointment you re lulled into a false sense of security with the oppulent lobby but once you re passed that it goes downhill very quickly our room was tiny with a tiny bathroom and a tiny tv a safe that didn t work and we had to get the security chap to look at it our room looked out onto a courtyard which from the sound of it had every dumpster in greater los angeles being emptied all night the valet parking was the slowest we have ever come across and none of the staff we met were particularly helpful or motivated the final straw was being told on our last day that the hotel was turning off all the water from 10 00 a m until 3 00 p m it would have been nice to be able to shower before a twelve hour flight home but that wasn t to be we have no plans to stay at this hotel again we d rather spend our money on a hotel more deserving that knows how to treat their guests ,0.023936171,0.020212766,negative,3,0,2,1

luxury hotel but only for sound sleepers  poor soundproofing hotel is full of contradictions as far as having some excellent features such as topnotch furnishings and very helpful and knowledgeable concierge yet having some serious downsides  including just about the worst soundproofing this frequent traveler has ever encountered doorways opening and closing the hotel elevator  at some distance from my room  and adjacent room s guest making his selection from his closet  you could hear hangers sliding across the bar were all plainly audible at first i thought the hallway revelry was due to some particularly unruly guests and then realized that poor soundproofing was at the heart of the problem as merely closing a door somewhere down the hall sounded like slamming another strange contradiction  the bedding is obviously very highend but relatively hard  i e it s a futon so it s great for those who think firm beds are better and a tough go if you like soft beds a major plus  the location could not be better within easy walking distance of outstanding shopping and dining it is ideal for those who like to be able to enjoy city amenities on foot rather than always having to drive if you are a very sound sleeper i d say this hotel is a great choice but if you favor a quiet rest i would recommend against it ,0.0625,0.05882353,neutral,4,0,0,2

a little out of the way for me this hotel was booked on the recommendation of my travel agent i must say i was a little disappointed  especially with the room they first gave me which was just looking over the main entrance and street i got them to change me to a better room on the other side with a nice view of la still i had paid quite a lot for this place and i think i was expecting a bit more the rooms are average and the bathroom is old fashioned and quite small but the beds are very nice and the toiletries in the bathroom are good the welcome sleep pack is a nice touch though mine was missing the cd  not that that mattered i didnt like the location though it was just that little too far removed from anything i probably would never stay here again but i cant knock the place  if you have a car then this place is ok the staff on reception are very nice too and very helpful however one thing i would watch out for is the hotel car  they charge exhorbitant rates to unwary travellers as i found to my dismay i ended up using cabs s they turned out much cheaper in the end even with traffic ,0.065,0.043333333,neutral,2,0,1,4

don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,0.03888889,0.047569446,negative,4,0,1,1

abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,0.02747678,0.032120742,negative,0,0,0,1

it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,0.04186603,0.03827751,negative,0,3,2,0

very comfortable stay after a long flight the crowne plaza was a welcome relief beautiful lobby helpful staff a huge room with nice city views and the most comfortable bed i have ever slept on we got a priority club upgrade which included a nice breakfast and a sleep pack please ignore people who say you can t walk anywhere we walked for about 25 minutes without problems to rodeo drive even though it was after 6pm and dark had a fab browse around saks barneys and some of the boutique shops that were still open and then stuffed ourselves silly at a mexican restaurant about five minutes walk from the hotel the next morning we hopped in a limousine arranged by the hotel for a three hour tour of hollywood hills the chinese theatre a few famous peoples houses and so on the same limo then took us to the airport for our flight back to london doing this saved us quite a lot of money and was much more convenient is it the lap of luxury no was it a comfortable stay most definitely ,0.04233871,0.039650537,positive,4,4,4,4

ok but expected more   my husband and i stayed at the hotel for two nights in may 2005 the service was really very good all around the bellhops and concierge were exceptionally helpful in arranging sightseeing tours for us the location is very convenient as others have said but we were disappointed in our room for the the crown plaza brand and price we were paying  which was not as inexpensive as some of the rates ive seen on this review board we expected more the carpet was worn out looking the furniture and decor were holiday inn basic the bathroom looked like it really needed an overhaul the shower curtain was dingy and poorly hung the towels didnt look very clean and were rough and worn out and our air conditioning unit had seen better days i think the hotel rooms should be renovated to maintain integrity with its brand and it wouldnt hurt to increase the temperature on the laundry setting and use some fabric softener i may stay there again but not if i can get a room around the corner at the avalon ,0.043421052,0.041447368,neutral,4,0,0,3

if you are looking for upscale don t look here even though i was upgraded to a nice sized one bedroom suite  i was staying free on my priority club points this hotel that touts itself as a luxury hotel and believe me this hotel is not luxurious they have renovated recently so the public areas seem pleasant at first glance however when you take a closer look the public areas are very dirty and not well maintained there was gum stuck to the wall in the lobby all 3 days i was there filthy glass entrance doors trash on the elevator floors dirty carpet etc the room seemed pretty clean except for the hair all over the bathroom floor gross the room itself had some nice touches but overall felt like an older holiday inn trying to disguise itself as something nicer service was indifferent except for the great concierge was helpful also not very luxurious was having to go out the front lobby doors to get to the pool which is located next to the street the club lounge was your basic hotel room with a cheap continental breakfast convenient but nothing special valet was understaffed  just the one bellman on staff one evening i had to get the car myself from the garage because he was too busy crowne plaze also announced it s new luxurious beds the bed was nice because it was brand new but actually very firm and not high quality location is ok if you have a car but not too much around walking distance this hotel is fine for basic no frills accomodations if you get a good low rate i wish i hadn t used my points here tho kind of a waste i would have stayed at a nicer holidayinn express ,0.07136964,0.051980197,negative,3,3,2,2

professional service with one problem we recently stayed at the sofitel la for 17 nights overall the service was excellent  professional fast and gracious however there was one issue and the way it was handled was surprisingly unprofessional first the goodthe rooms are comfortable  bathroom shower is excellent and huge beds are pretty good  they re new which counts for a lot but a little on the soft side due to a featherbed turndown service at night with bottles of evian someone always at the front door to welcome you and open the door once there was no one at the door and one of the valets saw me coming and ran to open it for me we had breakfast at simon 5 or 6 times and it was excellent each time they serve excellent french press coffee  i m a terrible coffee snob  one morning i asked for a new cup as i had let my coffee turn lukewarm instead i got an entire fresh new pot of french press once they forgot the avocado in my omelet and rushed out an entire plate of avocado they also let us sit forever on the sunny mornings we also had dinner and drinks at simon stone rose  the scene is a little too much but the food was excellent best thing to order is off the menu it s the iron chef burger tiny perfect burger fries with truffle oil and a little milkshake don t miss it the fitness center was clean and open from 5am  helpful when you re on a shoot  they also provided bottles of evian chilled towels and brownies or muffins internet access and computers and headphones a pretty complete place to hang out the spa has very nice treatments  i did a facial and a massage  though it is very pricey i m from new york and this compares to the priciest spas here however you can t top having a massage in a relaxing setting just a couple minutes from your hotel bed the sauna is not open yet unfortunately but the locker room is nice what else the location can t be beat we walked to dinner many nights  not sure that s even possible in other parts of la also walked to shopping on the weekend there were a couple very minor service issues along the way the maid opened our door and came in one morning at 830am while we were still in bed  she apologized and quickly left and the shampoo and conditioner were not replaced for days and i had to call housekeeping to get new ones sent up  but they came quickly  not big deals ok now the bad after we had been there 10 days with two cars parked the front desk called up to confirm our credit card because of all the charges piling up what charges we asked oh the 26 per day per car charge that s 884 extra for parking the rental cars for our 17 days i went to the front desk to speak with the manager i don t have a problem with paying whatever needs to be paid but i thought it was wrong we weren t told there s no mention on the valet ticket they hand you there s no mention in the literature in the room there s no mention in the packet they give you at checkin and there s no option to park in a separate lot instead of apologizing for not informing us of the charge and making some small gesture of good will  for example a 25 credit to the restaurant or spa or something that wouldn t cost them much  or god forbid an apology they just said this is la and parking is at a premium yes i said i understand i m from new york i don t have a problem with paying for parking i have a problem with the hotel sneaking charges onto my credit card it s something a less professional place would do and doesn t fit with the rest of our experience here anyway it continued this way for a while with the manager refusing to acknolwedge that we should have been told and getting increasingly more huffy did i mention we were there for 17 nightsin the end i paid the 884 and consoled myself with taking a few extra brownies and bottles of evian from the fitness center it s still a very nice place and though it pains me to say it i would probably stay there again ,0.04645594,0.030970626,positive,4,4,3,4
luxury hotel but only for sound sleepers  poor soundproofing hotel is full of contradictions as far as having some excellent features such as topnotch furnishings and very helpful and knowledgeable concierge yet having some serious downsides  including just about the worst soundproofing this frequent traveler has ever encountered doorways opening and closing the hotel elevator  at some distance from my room  and adjacent room s guest making his selection from his closet  you could hear hangers sliding across the bar were all plainly audible at first i thought the hallway revelry was due to some particularly unruly guests and then realized that poor soundproofing was at the heart of the problem as merely closing a door somewhere down the hall sounded like slamming another strange contradiction  the bedding is obviously very highend but relatively hard  i e it s a futon so it s great for those who think firm beds are better and a tough go if you like soft beds a major plus  the location could not be better within easy walking distance of outstanding shopping and dining it is ideal for those who like to be able to enjoy city amenities on foot rather than always having to drive if you are a very sound sleeper i d say this hotel is a great choice but if you favor a quiet rest i would recommend against it ,0.0625,0.05882353,neutral,4,0,0,2

good location and excellent service not perfect however   i booked the sofitel for a onenight stay on a midweek business trip to los angeles the hotel is nicely situated directly across from the beverly center one of la s best shopping malls good food and sightseeing options are right outside the door which is rare for la the hotel is modern and hip with very well kept grounds and an impressive entry area the rooms are also modern in appearance with flat panel tvs and sharp clean decor i found the service to be superior from the reception to the valet parking attendants no issues at checkin checkout or anywhere in between consistent with earlier reviews the room i was given was very small for the states if i was with my wife we would have been cramped but for one the size was fine i also found the room to be otherwise spotless and comfortable with a good view of the busy la street scene below the bed was comfortable and i slept well so in all i would recommend the sofitel for travelers to la or those on business it is well located and can be a good value especially if you shop around on discount internet websites ,0.07134434,0.037146226,positive,4,4,4,4

don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,0.03888889,0.047569446,negative,4,0,1,1

do not stay at the hotel royal a group of stayed at this hotel for a family get together and it was an awful place the front desk individuals are for the most part unprofessional and unhelpful the rooms are filthy   unsanitary to say the least the towels were always stained dirty and they the sheets did not fit on the bed there were no bathroom toiletries  except for soap available and the water never got hot in the shower the balcony suites consisted of a window going out to a balcony that was about to fall off the side of the building   what a sham we were never able to sleep in past 7 am because of the noise on the street and coming from other rooms this was a huge disappointment you do not feel safe at the hotel and arrive home unrested and wanting to sanitize everything in your suitcase try somewhere else   you will be very unhappy here no matter what your standards are ,0.026428571,0.06428572,negative,0,0,0,2
this place is a total ripoff i cancelled my reservation to this hotel on october 1st and asked for my deposit back they told me i would have to talk to the manager susan smith because she s the only one who handles refunds that in itself seemed odd to me anyway i called her office almost every day since the 1st but she was never there i left countless messages with my phone number but she never called me back it s been over two weeks now and i ve spent lots of money on long distance calls but the hotel still owes me 223 74 deposit on two rooms i threatened to complain to the better business bureau but it did no good i guess they don t care about customer service i m just really glad i didn t actually stay at this hotel what horrible service   never stay at a hotel that requires a deposit on the room as you may never get it back if you cancel ,0.03591954,0.04454023,negative,0,0,1,1

luxury hotel but only for sound sleepers  poor soundproofing hotel is full of contradictions as far as having some excellent features such as topnotch furnishings and very helpful and knowledgeable concierge yet having some serious downsides  including just about the worst soundproofing this frequent traveler has ever encountered doorways opening and closing the hotel elevator  at some distance from my room  and adjacent room s guest making his selection from his closet  you could hear hangers sliding across the bar were all plainly audible at first i thought the hallway revelry was due to some particularly unruly guests and then realized that poor soundproofing was at the heart of the problem as merely closing a door somewhere down the hall sounded like slamming another strange contradiction  the bedding is obviously very highend but relatively hard  i e it s a futon so it s great for those who think firm beds are better and a tough go if you like soft beds a major plus  the location could not be better within easy walking distance of outstanding shopping and dining it is ideal for those who like to be able to enjoy city amenities on foot rather than always having to drive if you are a very sound sleeper i d say this hotel is a great choice but if you favor a quiet rest i would recommend against it ,0.0625,0.05882353,neutral,4,0,0,2

a little out of the way for me this hotel was booked on the recommendation of my travel agent i must say i was a little disappointed  especially with the room they first gave me which was just looking over the main entrance and street i got them to change me to a better room on the other side with a nice view of la still i had paid quite a lot for this place and i think i was expecting a bit more the rooms are average and the bathroom is old fashioned and quite small but the beds are very nice and the toiletries in the bathroom are good the welcome sleep pack is a nice touch though mine was missing the cd  not that that mattered i didnt like the location though it was just that little too far removed from anything i probably would never stay here again but i cant knock the place  if you have a car then this place is ok the staff on reception are very nice too and very helpful however one thing i would watch out for is the hotel car  they charge exhorbitant rates to unwary travellers as i found to my dismay i ended up using cabs s they turned out much cheaper in the end even with traffic ,0.065,0.043333333,neutral,2,0,1,4

don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,0.03888889,0.047569446,negative,4,0,1,1

abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,0.02747678,0.032120742,negative,0,0,0,1

okay for what you pay this was a very average hotel very small bathroom the hotel is called the crown plaza beverly hills but it s actually in the city limits of los angeles just across the border from beverly hills if you want a clean safe relatively inexpensive place to lay your head this hotel will do the trick you must have a car to get around no public transportion nearby close to hollywood and the sites you cannot have a roll away in your room if there s already two beds in the room they will only allow a roll away if you have a room with a king bed this is important if you have your family and usually get a double with a roll away for an extra 5 you can upgrade your breakfast from the free priority club breakfast to the buffet it s worth the 5 to upgrade unless you only eat fruit and toast for breakfast ,0.040644173,0.01993865,neutral,3,3,3,3

okay if you are on a budget good things in this hotel good location helpful staff and comfy bed free wifi notsogood things the noise from the hallway is loud  wakes me up whenever anyone speaks outside avoid adjoining rooms as there is also a noise problem here had one to begin with and asked to change after i could hear ever word of the next door neighbour s conversation and they weren t even speaking loudly food is not so good and overpriced  go elsewhere  had forgotten my phone charger and when i phoned the concierge for one they didn t have any now this happened to me before and at any other halfway decent hotel i have stayed in  particularly ones that cater to business they always have extras to me this is not great overall verdict if you are on a budget and are not going to spend much time in your hotel room this place is okay it is quite basic however if you are looking for something a little more special i would pass am only staying here because someone else is paying  if i had my own choice i would stay somewhere else ,0.037990198,0.039215688,neutral,4,0,2,3

adequate but not inspiring this is not at all a sophiscated hotel  as claimed  its a 3 star hotel this is an ok place to stay adequate for 2 3 nights with clean comfortable rooms somewhere above the level of a motel the breakfasts are pricey not well cooked or presented and certainly not worth the money  denny s diners are not worrying about this place the hotel does have a few professionally well trained staff but the majority are far less experienced  they are however always very helpful  but most of them have spanish as their first language is it me or doesn t la actually have a centre  the nearest we got to seeing one in the evening was the farmers market  there aren t any farmers and it isn t a market  it does have a lot of shops that stay open late and unbelievably for america lots of restaurants quite full even after 8 00 pm  decandance or what   reassuringly they still didn t understand why we ordered a 2nd drink its well worth an evening visit ,0.048828125,0.039713543,neutral,3,0,0,3

luxury hotel but only for sound sleepers  poor soundproofing hotel is full of contradictions as far as having some excellent features such as topnotch furnishings and very helpful and knowledgeable concierge yet having some serious downsides  including just about the worst soundproofing this frequent traveler has ever encountered doorways opening and closing the hotel elevator  at some distance from my room  and adjacent room s guest making his selection from his closet  you could hear hangers sliding across the bar were all plainly audible at first i thought the hallway revelry was due to some particularly unruly guests and then realized that poor soundproofing was at the heart of the problem as merely closing a door somewhere down the hall sounded like slamming another strange contradiction  the bedding is obviously very highend but relatively hard  i e it s a futon so it s great for those who think firm beds are better and a tough go if you like soft beds a major plus  the location could not be better within easy walking distance of outstanding shopping and dining it is ideal for those who like to be able to enjoy city amenities on foot rather than always having to drive if you are a very sound sleeper i d say this hotel is a great choice but if you favor a quiet rest i would recommend against it ,0.0625,0.05882353,neutral,4,0,0,2

a little out of the way for me this hotel was booked on the recommendation of my travel agent i must say i was a little disappointed  especially with the room they first gave me which was just looking over the main entrance and street i got them to change me to a better room on the other side with a nice view of la still i had paid quite a lot for this place and i think i was expecting a bit more the rooms are average and the bathroom is old fashioned and quite small but the beds are very nice and the toiletries in the bathroom are good the welcome sleep pack is a nice touch though mine was missing the cd  not that that mattered i didnt like the location though it was just that little too far removed from anything i probably would never stay here again but i cant knock the place  if you have a car then this place is ok the staff on reception are very nice too and very helpful however one thing i would watch out for is the hotel car  they charge exhorbitant rates to unwary travellers as i found to my dismay i ended up using cabs s they turned out much cheaper in the end even with traffic ,0.065,0.043333333,neutral,2,0,1,4

don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,0.03888889,0.047569446,negative,4,0,1,1

abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,0.02747678,0.032120742,negative,0,0,0,1

it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,0.04186603,0.03827751,negative,0,3,2,0

crowne plaza generally good we had a short stay at the crowne plaza and found it to be a pleasant hotel and good value for money it had comfortable beds plenty of towels and all the usual amenities the cd player was a bonus the inroom coffee was awful the only thing we missed was a refrigerator in the room the location is excellent you can walk to a variety of restaurants shops and a supermarket though all the distances are rather long a bus to downtown via the restaurant area stops outside and various other bus lines are not too far away there is even a bus from beverly hills to the airport but we did not use it presumably if you were on a tight budget you could  buses 1 25  the staff were friendly and efficient with one exception we tried to book a tour but instead of telling us that it was not available the concierge first tried to get us to do it by limo and then rather aggressively started to sign us up for a different tour also another concierge was very reluctant to get us a taxi and wanted us to take the hotel s car  40  we insisted on a taxi and it turned out to be cheaper  28  ,0.052364863,0.043355856,positive,5,0,3,4
fantastic stay at the crowne plaza we stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills from july 20  23 and had a wonderful time from the moment we set foot in the door to the time we left all the staff were friendly and the facilities were excellent just as a tip to all future guests  make sure you sign up for the priority club  free to join  this entitles you to free breakfast each morning and there are dedicated floors within the hotel which are especially for priority club guests which have better views comfier beds the location of the crown plaza is around a 25minute walk to rodeo drive and approximately 3035 taxi ride to chinatown and downtown hollywood and approximately 25 30 to universal studios this means that if you do not have your own transport getting around could be difficult we were very impressed when one day we wanted to go to universal studios and were contemplating taking the bus train one of the hotel staff members who had just finished work for the day offered to drop us off to universal studio s on his way home as he lived in the area overall the level of customer service we received from all staff members at the crown plaza was excellent and i would definately recommend others to stay here also ,0.06277292,0.026200874,positive,4,4,3,4
ok but expected more   my husband and i stayed at the hotel for two nights in may 2005 the service was really very good all around the bellhops and concierge were exceptionally helpful in arranging sightseeing tours for us the location is very convenient as others have said but we were disappointed in our room for the the crown plaza brand and price we were paying  which was not as inexpensive as some of the rates ive seen on this review board we expected more the carpet was worn out looking the furniture and decor were holiday inn basic the bathroom looked like it really needed an overhaul the shower curtain was dingy and poorly hung the towels didnt look very clean and were rough and worn out and our air conditioning unit had seen better days i think the hotel rooms should be renovated to maintain integrity with its brand and it wouldnt hurt to increase the temperature on the laundry setting and use some fabric softener i may stay there again but not if i can get a room around the corner at the avalon ,0.043421052,0.041447368,neutral,4,0,0,3
disappointed after driving down from san francisco to la in early january 2004 we were expecting everything the crowne plaza however was disappointing the room was nice but cramped for two people the bed next to the bathroom just managed to allow the door to open but you could hear everything going on in the bathroom so not very private the water wouldn t drain whilst taking a shower so we stood in shampoo soap and conditioner until stepping out we called maintenance up who fixed it but the problem still occurred honestly we couldn t be bothered calling again the use of the internet downstairs in the lobby was good the nightlife on the strip on a thursday night was non existent and very disappointing venice beach fared better the following day ,0.04981203,0.05639098,negative,3,0,0,2

if you are looking for upscale don t look here even though i was upgraded to a nice sized one bedroom suite  i was staying free on my priority club points this hotel that touts itself as a luxury hotel and believe me this hotel is not luxurious they have renovated recently so the public areas seem pleasant at first glance however when you take a closer look the public areas are very dirty and not well maintained there was gum stuck to the wall in the lobby all 3 days i was there filthy glass entrance doors trash on the elevator floors dirty carpet etc the room seemed pretty clean except for the hair all over the bathroom floor gross the room itself had some nice touches but overall felt like an older holiday inn trying to disguise itself as something nicer service was indifferent except for the great concierge was helpful also not very luxurious was having to go out the front lobby doors to get to the pool which is located next to the street the club lounge was your basic hotel room with a cheap continental breakfast convenient but nothing special valet was understaffed  just the one bellman on staff one evening i had to get the car myself from the garage because he was too busy crowne plaze also announced it s new luxurious beds the bed was nice because it was brand new but actually very firm and not high quality location is ok if you have a car but not too much around walking distance this hotel is fine for basic no frills accomodations if you get a good low rate i wish i hadn t used my points here tho kind of a waste i would have stayed at a nicer holidayinn express ,0.07136964,0.051980197,negative,3,3,2,2

a little out of the way for me this hotel was booked on the recommendation of my travel agent i must say i was a little disappointed  especially with the room they first gave me which was just looking over the main entrance and street i got them to change me to a better room on the other side with a nice view of la still i had paid quite a lot for this place and i think i was expecting a bit more the rooms are average and the bathroom is old fashioned and quite small but the beds are very nice and the toiletries in the bathroom are good the welcome sleep pack is a nice touch though mine was missing the cd  not that that mattered i didnt like the location though it was just that little too far removed from anything i probably would never stay here again but i cant knock the place  if you have a car then this place is ok the staff on reception are very nice too and very helpful however one thing i would watch out for is the hotel car  they charge exhorbitant rates to unwary travellers as i found to my dismay i ended up using cabs s they turned out much cheaper in the end even with traffic ,0.065,0.043333333,neutral,2,0,1,4

the jewel in the crowne we won this holiday on the radio when we arrived at lax we were met by a shuttle service approx transfer time was 1 hour due to traffic and other drop off s check in was very straight forward they asked us if we would like to leave a credit card imprint or not there was no pressure to do so the room was a decent size with 2 queen sized beds and a large bright bathroom with shower and bath the room also had a cd player and a large television and coffee maker the ice machine was just down the hallway the location of the hotel was a little out of the way and without a car it would have been a struggle getting about i can highly recommend the car hire company under the hotels parking lot breakfast was excellent and plentiful overall for location and facilities this hotel was a little overpriced but what the heck it cost us nothing  i would stay here again as it made an ideal base for a fantastic holiday and will be in our memories forever ,0.028645834,0.04296875,positive,2,5,2,3

don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,0.03888889,0.047569446,negative,4,0,1,1

abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,0.02747678,0.032120742,negative,0,0,0,1

okay for what you pay this was a very average hotel very small bathroom the hotel is called the crown plaza beverly hills but it s actually in the city limits of los angeles just across the border from beverly hills if you want a clean safe relatively inexpensive place to lay your head this hotel will do the trick you must have a car to get around no public transportion nearby close to hollywood and the sites you cannot have a roll away in your room if there s already two beds in the room they will only allow a roll away if you have a room with a king bed this is important if you have your family and usually get a double with a roll away for an extra 5 you can upgrade your breakfast from the free priority club breakfast to the buffet it s worth the 5 to upgrade unless you only eat fruit and toast for breakfast ,0.040644173,0.01993865,neutral,3,3,3,3
reliable option in los angeles i recently stayed at the crowne plaza beverly hills for 3 days in june 2006 and i have to say i have only one real complaint although the complaint i have is not to be undervalued we arrived a little after 300 pm and were told that our room was not ready this is of course a little unnerving after travelling for about 7 hours but understandable if the problem is taken care of quickly we waited for over an hour before being let into our room which was not even made up to drop off our luggage we decided rather than sit in the hotel and wait for our room to be cleaned we would go exploring we came back to the hotel several hours later and our rooms were finally cleaned this was the only real complaint i had during our stay but as i said it is a really big complaint the best thing about this hotel are the beds i have stayed in many intercontinental hotels most recently in atlanta and i must say they have the most comfortable hotel beds i have ever slept in it is good to see that intercontinental has made the commitment to upgrade the crowne plaza hotel range bedding as well even if there was no featherbed the hotel decor is very much like a holiday inn but this is considered a value hotel and no one should expect the ritz when staying here the continental breakfast served in the mornings for priority club members is a wonderful value and just the thing to start a busy day of exploring and shopping another hotel perk so to speak was the use of the 24 hour fitness gym about a 1 4 of a mile down the road from the hotel the facility has workout machines free weights cardio machines as well as organized classes which can all be accessed by crowne plaza guests for free now as for the hotel s location anyone coming to los angeles should understand that no location in los angeles is ever entirely convenient if you do not have a car it is very hard to move around the city the crowne plaza is only a 15 minute walk to rodeo dr and is right on beverly which has a number of restaurants and shops all within walking distance of the hotel if you can handle a tedious checkin as we did the crowne plaza is a reliable valuehotel option in los angeles within reasonable driving distance to many attractions and offers guests comfortable beds complimentary fitness center privileges and a good continental breakfast what more can someone ask for in this price range ,0.043502204,0.030837005,positive,2,4,4,4

crowne plaza generally good we had a short stay at the crowne plaza and found it to be a pleasant hotel and good value for money it had comfortable beds plenty of towels and all the usual amenities the cd player was a bonus the inroom coffee was awful the only thing we missed was a refrigerator in the room the location is excellent you can walk to a variety of restaurants shops and a supermarket though all the distances are rather long a bus to downtown via the restaurant area stops outside and various other bus lines are not too far away there is even a bus from beverly hills to the airport but we did not use it presumably if you were on a tight budget you could  buses 1 25  the staff were friendly and efficient with one exception we tried to book a tour but instead of telling us that it was not available the concierge first tried to get us to do it by limo and then rather aggressively started to sign us up for a different tour also another concierge was very reluctant to get us a taxi and wanted us to take the hotel s car  40  we insisted on a taxi and it turned out to be cheaper  28  ,0.052364863,0.043355856,positive,5,0,3,4

ok but expected more   my husband and i stayed at the hotel for two nights in may 2005 the service was really very good all around the bellhops and concierge were exceptionally helpful in arranging sightseeing tours for us the location is very convenient as others have said but we were disappointed in our room for the the crown plaza brand and price we were paying  which was not as inexpensive as some of the rates ive seen on this review board we expected more the carpet was worn out looking the furniture and decor were holiday inn basic the bathroom looked like it really needed an overhaul the shower curtain was dingy and poorly hung the towels didnt look very clean and were rough and worn out and our air conditioning unit had seen better days i think the hotel rooms should be renovated to maintain integrity with its brand and it wouldnt hurt to increase the temperature on the laundry setting and use some fabric softener i may stay there again but not if i can get a room around the corner at the avalon ,0.043421052,0.041447368,neutral,4,0,0,3

just fine this hotel is located in pioneer square though just a quick walk to the water front pike s market however the immediate location is a bit rough around the edges and there is a very apparent homeless population once you ve walked several blocks away towards the market it gets noticeably better the hotel is very nice  our room was spacious and nicely decorated there was a very toxic cleaning agent odor that required us to open the windows and leave them open otherwise it was a nice big room with a good sized bathroom breakfast was great it is served in an adjoining breakfast room cafe to the hotel and includes cereal pastries bagels and then some above and beyond most continental included breakfasts the parking is about 1 1 2 blocks away and costs 18 a day it s relatively convenient though when we returned back to the lot around 9 or 10 pm after attending a wedding it was sketchy there were a few shady characters lingering around the garage  it s locked and requires access but once your key card opens the door anyone can cruise in after you  all in all it s a convenient decent place for a reasonable price if you re looking for luxury this isn t it but it s more than adequate ,0.057819385,0.02092511,neutral,2,4,3,0
best hotel my husband and i have stayed in the hotel numerous times in the last couple of years and would never stay anywhere else we have recommended the hotel to family and friends who have also loved staying there i have to say that from the moment you walk into the hotel you feel like someone cares for your needs and the staff is very courteous and friendly the rooms were very well taken care of and extremly clean the rates were excellant especially if you are there in downtown seattle for just a overnight visit my sister and i stayed at the hotel while we had a three day shopping trip in seattle and everday the room was cleaned with special goodies left in the room for us it was great because transportation was right there so we didn t have to use our vehicle to drive places and have the terrible time trying to find parking   everything was right there we loved our stay and being pampered that we did not want to go home this is a wonderful hotel with fantastic staff that make you feel at home i would never stay anywhere else ,0.059375,0.031875,positive,5,0,5,5

lack of customer service skills and overpriced we found this place online and made a reservation through third party booking like many we were just staying one night and sharing the room with friends when we arrived we were politely greeted our reservation was for 4 persons per our confirmation letter when they asked how many guests we told them 4 and they said that the extra guest cost was 20 00 for each person per night our rate was already over 150 00 for a room with 2 double beds we told them that our reservation was for 4 persons and they said their system said 2 persons we went ahead and took the room at this time nobody told us anything about parking and we had to ask we were then given a key for the garage and told it would be 50 if we lost the key and 100 on sunday if we left it in the car because the garage is closed on sundays nothing more was said about parking we left and went to the ball game returning late in the evening we received our keys and went to the extremely small room we walked in and it had a view of the brick building next door the room was very clean when we checked out the next morning we asked again about the rate and produced the confirmation letter we were told that we were getting the best rate available and that we would have to take it up with the third party booking company we then questioned the charge for the parking we were never told about the 18 00 to park in the garage we told them such and were told he was the manager and insisted that the person checking us in told us we told him that he had checked us in and that he only told us about the key charged for the garage and never the parking amount he then told us that he always tells guests and that he was the manager he would not work with us at all on the price even though we were never told about the parking fee or that our confirmation letter showed 4 persons so in turn we ended up paying 240 00 for a room that you could find at any budget motel the breakfast leaves something to be desired the floor was filthy with food and the food was not well stocked counters were dirty and the staff was sitting behind the counter talking we walked up to the corner tullys instead i would never stay at this motel again having worked for hotels for the past 7 years i do not know how they keep guests if we treated a guest as they had we would be out of business i would recommend customer service training we will never stay there again and we will tell many people about our experience this is definately not what we expected from a best western we gave it a 2 because it was clean ,0.023832684,0.027966926,negative,0,1,1,1
the customer is not always right at the pioneer square it was a sunday night in april and we were in town for a concert and after the evening crew gave a great effort physically showing us a few of the different rooms  which were some of the smallest i ve ever seen with views of backend brick walls  they led us to believe when we asked about parking that we could either park on the street at no charge that night or park in the garage a block up the road when we were thinking about getting a parking pass to save hassle for later they simply said talk to the night shift when you get back and they will set you up after coming back that night a young man was working who claimed he was new and got his manager when we asked about the parking when we asked for the parking pass he wanted 15 and we refused telling him we were led to believe by the conversation with the evening shift that it was free the manager told us that that wasn t his policy as he pulled out his hotel policy book and that we either had to pay the 15 or park on the street which started on the meter at 7 am this was great news coming at 1 am and exhausted we felt cheated in an obvious bluff attempt he then proceeded to tell us that he would check the video tape  as he told us everything was recorded throughout the day and if we weren t told about the charge he would give us our pass at no charge when i accepted the offer staring him in the face he then proceeded to go back on his offer and again refused to offer the pass running in circles you mean they didn t give you the pass yet excuse me what if i had the pass already i would have been in a parking lot parking my car and not in the middle of an argument about paying it we had only been there checked in hours earlier and told the manager that we wanted our money back and would go find another hotel in that case he refused he would not refund us our money and we were forced to stay there that night it was late we were tired and he was running in circles with his lame arguments we decided to wake up at 7 am pay the meter for a couple more hours and leave i wasn t giving this place another dollar the next day we found another hotel near the space needle and were treated with the utmost respect and in subsequent visits will never stay at that dive again the only good thing and the reason i gave a 2 and not a 1 was the one bellhop that showed us the small rooms and helped us with the door that would never swipe and really helped us out the place is a nice location but based on this experience the lack of management skills and others that i read that had the same parking problem there are other hotels and i would pass on the pioneer square best western ,0.025,0.02909091,negative,4,0,0,2

everything you could hope for my friends and i do a road trip to a different nfl venue every year this was a great place to stay in seattle we like to hit up a few tourist spots in addition to the stadium itself and this hotel proved the perfect location to accomplish that it s within easy walking distance of the space needle pike place market and basically anywhere downtown if you have no problem walking you can even walk to the stadiums with little issue  45 minutes maybe  which we did as for the hotel itself it s been recently remodeled so it s very clean and modern the bedding was the most comfortable i ve experienced in recent memory and the breakfast is very legit  it s beyond a continental breakfast but not quite a real breakfast  the price was a ridiculous bargain  75 night but this place was so perfect for what we were looking for i would ve been happy if i d paid 125 the staff was very friendly great location outstanding pricing it s the dream scenario for a budget traveler looking for the ideal location but it has enough frills that even a more high maintenance individual would be more than happy ,0.044767443,0.031976745,positive,4,0,5,5

got what we paid for but great breakfast enjoy your breakfast and the thought that you are saving money  but that is about it we stayed just overnight and this is the duration that i recommend to everyone first if you are from outside u s  make sure you print out the sheet  ie travelocity or expedia page showing that you get free parking we had a dispute with the front desk who said they do not give free parking but if we could prove it they would be more than happy to accommodate we had to use their internet  free luckily to print out the page and show to them second bedding linens were worn out and must have been from the 70s but were clean checked for roaches etc but none so i guess they earned their 2 stars carpet is threadbare you get a fuzzy tv with full cable and a reasonable sized fridge  no alcohol and microwave we were offput by the dispensing machines in the bathroom where you pressed buttons to get shampoo and soap how cheap is thatconstruction in the neighborhood begins at 7am sharp where we were woken by jackhammer drill early in the morning breakfast was excellent in a huge breakfast room and includes yogourt waffles  you make your own  pastries fruit cereal milk hard boiled eggs toast bagels we were disgruntled by our room but the free breakfast somewhat made us feel better elevator is sometimes slow cleaning staff don t say hello or smile i guess don t care about guests considering this is 2 star hotel take the stairs if you can location is central although seems area is kind of seedy if not dead lots of car lots around you can walk to downtown within 10 minutes they leave a card on your bed warning you to be cautious about safety in this area and maybe it is warranted we enjoyed phantom of the opera while we were there parking is close but expensive and around 20 for events get what you pay for ,0.040014163,0.032223795,neutral,4,5,3,3

horrible and annoying be careful if you are about to book this hotel the room is ok but the location is not and we were bothered by some people who always complained to the front desk that the noise of our room was too annoying maybe it was just some people here who were not friendly but you can notice that the front desk here is quite offish and unfriendly too the first night we set the volume to normal level according to our experience at other hotels  san francisco and other places right before we came here  and somebody called front desk to complain about the noise alright we then made the sound as unnoticeable as possible but that guy knocked on the wall heavily when we were about to sleep and the tv was off next day we adjusted the volume bar to only one fifth of the bar but that guy was still complaining by calling the front desk and knocking on our wall what s wrong with watching tv at 9pm with just a little sound maybe the wall is paper thinthe front desk should come up to solve the problem and i actually asked the front desk to do so however he was really offish and unhelpful really annoying and horrible experience don t come if you wanna have a good mood while traveling ,0.045454547,0.065476194,negative,1,0,2,1
disappointing weekend at best western loyal inn seattle this hotel is on the seedy edge of seattle check in was ok and the desk clerk was helpful with planning a city tour upon entering the room my friend and i were barely able to wend our way between the overlarge pieces of furniture and beds the opening to the dressing room closet vanity area was less than 23 located directly off of the entry area to the room there were a total of nine lamps and wall fixtures of which only 2 could be lighted they offer a nice breakfast included in the price of the room but the eating area becomes quite messy as the morning passes there seemed to be a shortage of staff at least while we were there it was a big football game weekend and the hotel was at full occupancy the bed linens were said to be new but the mattress and box springs were very worn and shabby the color scheme of the draperies upholstery and bedding was disconcerting we wrote a letter to the corporate headquarters detailing our dissatisfaction and received a quasi form letter explaining that they are in the process of redecorating some rooms so the rooms might have had both old and new furniture in them no other excuse was given for the lighting problems this particular room should really not have been offered to guests usually best western has been quite satisfactory but this occasion was not up to their advertised standards ,0.031496063,0.044783466,negative,0,0,0,4

comfortable but not perfect i stayed at the best western executive because a group i belong to was using it for a weekend conference i have read the other comments and have to agree with may things i read here the lack of sound proofing is evident as i could hear the maids vacuuming the adjacent rooms however i did not hear any of my neighbors  they were either quiet or the rooms were empty i was on the 5th floor pretty far down the hall away from the elevator and they told me that this would be a quiet area which it proved to be another person in my group had the room from hell  evidently their neighbors were partying all night loudly and when the front desk was called the party would die down only long enough to pass inspection and them booted up as soon as the management left i overheard comments about the restaurant food being overpriced but i did not eat there i did notice that the bar was closed up and deserted by 11 pm on a saturday night despite the fact that our group was still using the adjacent room and many people wanted to wander over to the bar for a drink the hotel is nonsmoking except for a small area in the bar  this is a big plus for me the location is extremely good if you are planning to go to the seattle center they do accept pets  and welcomed my dog who was certainly pushing their 50lb limit  but they did charge a hefty one time 35 00 pet fee i don t mind some kind of pet fee  but this seems a little high while they have security measures in the garage at night  you have to use your room key to enter the gate  it is still a deserted garage and i don t think i would want to be caught down there waiting for the extremely slow elevator if someone snuck in behind me before the outside automatic gate closed  during the day the gate was open all the time  the neighborhood is industrial and there are some strange characters wandering around at night for the most part if felt safe  if you paid attention while you walked around i don t know about the shuttle  but i heard that a lot of people were waiting for it so you don t want to be in a rush when you use it the room itself was clean and comfortable big pluses are the refrigerator  dorm room size with no minibar items using up the space and the microwave as well as the wifi connection but be warned if you plan to leave your computer in your room  a member of our group was robbed of a couple thousand dollars worth of electronic gadgets when the thief slipped in when the maid was cleaning the room acting as though they were the registered guest there is a computer in their business office that you can use the comments about the different attitudes of the staff was very true  some people were enthusiastic and helpful while others just wanted to quote me the corporate bible rules that supported them denying me an adjustment for the ridiculous pet fee my rate was probably not the lowest rate as others have reported getting a better rate via expedia or price line if you can get a bargain rate and request a quiet room this becomes an even greater value it is easy in the daytime to walk everywhere if you like walking and seattle is a great town to see by foot the parking for our group was free and apparently it is free for all guests based on the other comments i have seen here but you might want to check with the hotel i did notice that they were using one outlet with an multiplug adapter and did inform the management that a fire inspector would probably frown on this as a fire hazard i would hope that they corrected this ,0.043159027,0.04047278,neutral,0,3,4,3

grace inn i attended a conference at the best western grace inn and conference center at ahwatukee in phonix last week first the good parts   the public areas at the hotel were really quite nice and the conference rooms had the unique feature of opening on to the pool patio area with absolutely fabulous weather we had those doors open all day and night and it was such a nice departure from the usual closed in conference atmosphere the pool area was quite nice and it looked like the restroom in the lobby had been recently remodeled now for the not so good   the rooms needed some updating badly it was a sparcely furnished huge room with a flat planklike bed a small sofa and a chair a desk and a tv cabinet and even with all of that in there the place seemed cavernously empty old old drapes and bedspread and in that whole humongous room one teeny little picture on the wall made it look uncomfortably spartan the whole room slanted towards one wall and one morning when i opened up my drapes a bit past the window i found a huge crack in the wall seems like the whole place is on it s way to toppling my friends had a room that slanted even more than mine   one of them had trouble staying on her bed without sliding out another friend had a shower head that was hanging off the wall on arrival the main elevators in the lobby weren t working and it took most of the next day for them to be fixed   so we had to use the freight elevator to get our stuff up to our rooms the restaurant takes the prize for the world s worst breakfast buffet and service one morning i sat there for 20 minutes and no one even came around for a drink order no coffee   thank heavens i was able to scrounge some up at the conference if you re attending a conference there really isn t too much in the way of lodging close by   there s a hotel accross the highway but it s a very busy highway sort of like a freeway actually so it wouldn t really be convenient to stay elsewhere there are however several restaurants within walking distance if it s not your vacation you can tough it out for a couple of nights for a conference   but if you re considering this place for a vacation  i d stay elsewhere ,0.04485321,0.03312844,negative,0,1,2,0

ok for the money location is great convenient to i10 tempe and south mountain hotel is clean but showing its age and has some minor maintenance issues for example the bathroom exhaust fan only worked intermittently and looked like it was going to fall out of the ceiling it took several minutes  5 to get hot water on the 5th floor most mornings the shower was cold the hotel staff although friendly and helpful seemed in denial that we could possibly have problems with hot water they did agree to turn it up and we finally had our hottest shower on the last day for some reason housekeeping shorted us on towels and coffiee packets on occasion we had a onebedroom suite which was very nice considering we were travelling with a 1year old he had his own room and the curtains were very dark so he could nap during the day they advertise complimentary cribs when available although they tried to tell me it was 10 a day when i called them directly to make the reservation the sheet provided with the crib was not fitted but was just a folded fullsize flat sheet fortunately we brought our own fitted crib sheet which worked much better the hotel advertises complimentary highspeed internet but that really meant free wifi in public areas of the hotel only and some rooms had wired connections our room did not have a wired internet connection but since it overlooked the pool area we were able to get intermittent wifi connections some rooms come with complimentary breakfast for two ours did not since we received a discounted rate however there is a mcdonad s within walking distance next door and a safeway and several restaurants nearby ,0.04066781,0.023116438,neutral,5,0,3,4

not worth all the praise   i booked this hotel for a romantic getaway after reading all the fabulous reviews on trip advisor however the visit was not half of what i expected i booked one of the casita rooms and while the bathroom was excellent the rest of the room was dark dusty and not particularly appealing to make things worse there were black bugs all over the room  rolipolis i am not sure if they have a more technical name  the night we checked in there was nothing we could do about it except hope for the best the second night the staff sprayed the room however the bugs remained and they had to come back in the next few days as well not what i would expect from such a pricey and wellrated venue nothing was done to compensate us for this continuously unpleasant experience additionally the reception staff and restaurant wait staff as mentioned by another reviewer was not particularly friendly or helpful they did not recommend restaurants excursion trips or anything that would be useful for one first visit to pheonix we were also charged 70 for minibar items that we did not use i had to call the hotel once i saw my credit card bill to have the charges reversed to be honest the only service i was really happy with was the valet service the pool was ok aysmall and felt more like a backyard pool than one of a hotel resort the rest of the grounds are very lovely nice flowers and architecture but other than that i found nothing exceptional or redeeming about the royal palsm there are many amazing hotel options in pheonix when i return it will definitely not be to this venue ,0.058305368,0.054949664,negative,3,0,2,3

simply great hotel with service to match just had a wonderful six night stay at the palms with my wife had a shock at checkin when they told me of the 22 a night service charge but it was worth every cent due to the excellent friendly staff at the resort  special mention to the pool staff and the car valets  who earned it and more very few negatives and lots of positives the pool area is not the largest and would be pushed to serve everyones needs when the hotel is full however when it is quiet as when we were there then it is ideal staff keep you supplied with constant iced water  free of charge  food if required and move the parasols when required so you do not over do the sunbathing  unless you realy do want to fry  rooms comforable and there is a turn down service supplied at night the attention to detail is excellent will be going back again as it also makes an excellent base to see the rest of arizona ,0.048913043,0.027853262,positive,5,0,5,5

could do better spent two nights here in june having read the rave reviews we were somewhat disappointed first impressions were certainly not good the reception staff did not exactly fall over themselves to be helpful and the decor seemed a little faded the pool area was very average and some new soft furnishing was clearly needed  felt better when we had settled in the room was large and comforatble and my wife loved the bath enjoyed an excellent meal in the restaurant though again the decoration was a little old fashoined highlight of stay was sitting in a courtyard with a bottle of wine under the stars liked the feel of the place in the evening with lots of clever lighting and quiet acoustic guitar overall it was ok think they will need to up their game if they want to maintain their prices the spanish colonial theme is great but clearly needs a little refurbishment  ,0.0767405,0.037183546,neutral,0,5,3,2
a little disappointing   we stayed at the royal palms resort over father s day weekend and left with mixed emotions we booked a standard room and while it was clean and nicely appointed it was quite small the bath tub was ridiculous an older person would have found it unuseable we almost needed a step stool to get into it we found the concierge to be helpful enough but the front desk attendant seemed to have a forced smile and never mailed our postcards  after offering to do so  we had a delicious dinner at t cook s our table was disappointing though it was right next to the kitchen even though we had made the reservation months in advance and were obviously hotel guests on a brighter note our food server could not have been more attentive and gracious the grounds of the royal palms are pretty and the valet attendants were very speedy and pleasant however we have stayed at many other four and five star resorts in the phoenix scottsdale area and would probably not return to royal palms we have found much better service value and accomodations at the sanctuary and the phoenician ,0.049129352,0.04291045,negative,0,3,0,4

a perfect romantic getaway my husband and i were looking for a great place for a romantic getaway for 3 nights after a lot of research of phoenix and scottsdale resorts we choose royal palms mainly because it is more exclusive and smaller than the large resorts  the phoenician is a couple of streets over  especially after learning that it was spring break and many hotels were close to being 100 booked i definitely didn t want to go to a place that was so booked that i would have to wait for everything pool gym breakfast valet the royal palms makes you feel like you are among very few people and have alot of privacy they have a very nice pool  just 1 and the staff throughout the hotels is very attentive and nice the valet and bellmen are just wonderful we never had to wait long to pick up or drop off our car the front desk even printed out our boarding passes the day before we left which we are so grateful of after seeing the enormous lines at the airport we may have been late for the flight in which case my husband would have yelled at me for since i am always running late this is the kind of place for someone looking for privacy and doesn t care about having 3 pools and many loung bars through the hotel it is a smaller hotel but that really is the beauty of it the grounds are absolutely gorgeous with camelback mountain in the back drop the hotel itself is mediteranean style with beautiful antique pieces throughout the doorways each have so much character they look as though they have been there for 100 years the spa was lovely we had a couple s massage followed by a botanical bath in a private room with a small terrace we would definitely stay there if we ever return to phoenix ,0.05483129,0.023006136,positive,5,5,5,5
nice place we stayed here for four nights in february we reserved a deluxe casita and were pleased with the room it was a little smaller than we expected but certainly cozy it is an old resort but they have done well at maintaining the rooms and the amenities the grounds were meticulously maintained and staff was very pleasant the restaurant t cooks was very good the atmosphere was lively but quiet   busy but comfortable we recommend the espresso martinis after dinner instead of coffee   but be careful   after the caffeine wares off   you might find yourself crawling to your room all in all a nice experience ,0.09130435,0.032608695,positive,0,4,4,4

perfection i don t know where to start this hotel is simply spectactular i was a guest at the hotel in june 2007 traveling to arizona to attend a wedding i first took a quick side trip to tucson to visit friends and stayed at the arizona inn there how disappointing beautiful grounds great pool but the room was mediocre a bit tattered and worn and overall did not measure up to the positive reviews i saw on tripadvisor and which prompted me to book my stay there so my expectations were relatively muted when i made my way to phoenix and royal palms on entering the property i was blown away by the stunning architecture and gardening in the reservation desk area they had a pitcher of tasty and refreshing pink lemonade  lord knows it was certainly hot  and i was greeted warmly by the reservation agent here s where things started to get real good traveling in the offseason i thought i d secured a pretty good deal  i believe it was 150 night for one of their basic rooms well without even asking i was upgraded to one of the new spa suite rooms when the bellboy took me to my room and opened the door i almost fainted it was stunning on entering the room the sounds of soothing acoustic music enveloped you the lighting was just right dim and romantic the first part of the room is a sitting area with a luxurious turkishlike seatte full of comfy pilows  across from that you had an impressive entertainment unit and a small wet bar area in the center of the room was the most luxurious bath i ve ever had the privilege of looking at let alone using deep soaking tub those bowl sinks that sit on top of the the vanity a walkin steam shower lotions shower gels shampoo and conditioners that were heavenly you then enter the bedroom and it was the most comfortable bed i ve ever slept on just gorgeous dark stained wood floors two plasma tvs  one in the sitting area another in the bedroom  and to top it off a beautiful balcony that looked over a stunning courtyard area one afternoon we were serenaded by a spanish guitartist pinch me  i must be dreaming  unfortunately it was so daggone hot i couldn t really take advantage of the balcony also because i was running around a bit for wedding activities a long day trip to the grand canyon and the police concert the monday before i left i really didn t get to enjoy the room for my 4 night stay as much as i would have liked but that just gives me an excuse to make a return trip  during a better cooler  time of the year oh  and service talk about going the extra mile i discovered that my credit card was missing from my purse i couldn t find it anywhere i wasn t sure if i d dropped it while shopping or possibly in the car well one of the valets did a painstaking search throughout my rental car and managed to find the card in a really obscure location i guess it had fallen out of my purse while i was driving i was so grateful for the time and effort this gentleman put into finding the lost item overall service was exemplary throughout my stay royal palms has spoiled me for life when it comes to hotel accomodations i doubt there is a place that will ever measure up to my experience last summer the surprise factor alone of getting such a beautiful room at a fraction of it s normal nightly rate is something i ll likely never experience again in a nutshell royal palms is simply amazing  or as one of my good friends likes to put it all that and a bag of chips   you won t be disappointed   ,0.05241369,0.04561458,positive,5,5,5,5
royal palms is royal in every way we ve been to royal palms resort 3 times now and i can t imagine staying anywhere else in the phoenix area i was there once with my daughter for her college spring break for the ladies fling once with my husband for our anniversary and once as a family this resort was great for all of these vacations it is small which is a refreshing change from staying at huge hotels it was pricey but worth saving up for we were treated like royalty i liked the resort fee concept which relieved us of having to worry about tipping the staff everyone working there seemed to truely enjoy their jobs the rooms were luxurous in a tasteful comfortable way and we could enjoy our mornings and evenings on the patio right outside our room the grounds and pool were gorgeous if i had to find something that wasn t perfect it would be that they were short of pool chairs during peek swimming times and some guests would stake them out for the entire day however when we were at the pool we felt like we were really on vacation sipping our drinks delivered to us poolside the spa was awesome and dining at the restaurant was truely a gourmet experience staying at the royal palms is magical ,0.03761062,0.022123894,positive,5,5,5,5
not all it is cracked up to be my husband and i just stayed at the royal palms hotel to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary although the grounds are very beautiful the rooms are romantic and t cook s restaurant and lounge and the service by the pool are all extraordinary the business end of the hotel leaves quite a bit to be desired when we arrived our room was not ready and the person at the checkin desk said he would call within the hour to let us know what the status of our check in would be when we had not received a phone call more than two hours later we stopped by the front desk the person did not seem to remember us but another person at the desk asked if our phone number was on file and said that she would call the second royal palms representative did call and we ended up checking in about 330 pm  which is a 1 2 hour before the scheduled checkin time even though i sent a request asking about an early checkin since i knew that we would be arriving around 10 am  although we understand that our room was not ready early i would have appreciated the call that the first representative said that he was going to make so that we could have made a better use of our afternoon i was surprised that the room did not have a fireplace i had called the property to inquire about fireplaces in the deluxe casitas  where we were booked  and was told that those rooms did have fireplaces yet we were placed in a room without one the room was cozy but i was looking forward to this particular amenity on the second night of our stay we had to call housekeeping to receive turn down service and request to have our towels changed my biggest problem with the royal palms was the checkout billing procedure first my minor issue i had asked for our boarding passes to be printed  since that is a service that the royal palms offers  but the person at the front desk did not remember to give them to me until i asked ok a little oversight but coupled with what followed it just made the little oversight magnified my major issue has to do with billing first we were given the wrong bill  with someone who was charged about half what we paid per night for lodging  then we were given our bill with three nights charges for rose petal turndown service when we only had that service the first night the royal palms checkout representative then deducted the subsequent two nights and informed us that we would receive an updated email version of our bill before we were charged i did not receive the email version of the bill but my credit card was charged for the total of the invoice i received upon departure and an additional amount after calling the resort several times to speak with someone in accounting i left a message asking someone to send me an updated  and corrected invoice with an explanation of any additional charges  when i received the email with an updated copy of my bill there was another fraudulent charge i spoke with someone after receiving that invoice and she seemed a bit annoyed with my inquiries and requests to have the charges explained and removed finally there were so many events being hosted at the royal palms  at least one every day of our visit  that the staff often seemed pulled away from their lodging guests it seemed that during our stay there was not sufficient staff to address the needs of all guests those lodging at the property and those hosting special events for a property of this size requesting what the royal palms requests per night for lodging service should be seamless and all guests should feel like they are very special we are not picky guests if it were not for the abovementioned snafus we would have never interacted with the royal palms staff since i had arranged all of our activities and dining options prior to arrival in the event that the service is not seamless and the guests are not made to feel extra special the property management should followup with guests to the best of their ability to explain the situation and offer some sort of compensation i have traveled extensively for business and pleasure and have stayed in large and small hotels where the management generally seemed to be concerned with the wellbeing of the guests i did not feel that this was the approach at the royal palms hotel ,0.033010013,0.035043806,negative,4,5,1,1
great for romance not to do business  robynne reiber nyc after reading all the great reviews of this hotel i decided it sounded just perfect for my one night in scottsdale i was finishing up a long and difficult week of traveling to several cities and thought doing my last day of business in a spa and resort would help chill me out but this place is for romance for couples for people who want to veg out at the spa and try to take themselves to another level all i wanted was a computer connection that worked to be left alone to write and lot of hot coffee not exactly a match made in heaven truthfully i felt like i was living in an alternative universe where everyone just smiled and nodded and repeatedly asked me if i was having a fabulous time w hen my room wasn t ready and i had to wait 2 hours the nice lady at the front desk suggested i get a hot stone message while i waited  it would clear me out and help my writing then once i got into my room and was just falling into a nap during the only 2 hours i had to rest in my room before finishing up my business someone knocked on my door woke me up and offered me tea okay so you get it this place is gorgeous the grounds manicured to within an inch of their life the rooms are exceedingly comfortable and meant totally for romance and if this is you please do come because you ll probably give it 5 stars like the many given in the past but if you have stress and have to produce work stay away because like me you ll end up leaving more stressed and more on edge than when you entered ,0.045418005,0.03255627,neutral,5,0,0,5
beautiful resort with excellent service after reading the reviews on this website and a few others my husband and i decided to book a room at this resort for our anniversary the resorts website indicated that there would be a 22 per day resort fee which covered valet service gratuities fitness center etc   even so i was not sure as to whether or not we should tip the valet i went and ahead and attempted to give him the tip and he immediately said no mam everything is already covered we are at your service i can t tell you how nice it was to not have to worry about figuring any of that out i was amazed at how friendly all of the staff at the resort where the receptionist to the valets all the way to the bellhops they definitely made us feel welcome we even had a message waiting of us on the phone welcoming us to the resort i booked the least expensive room so i wasn t expecting much but the room was georgeous with both a front and back patio to sit on the bed was very large and very comfortable the beautiful scenery excellent service and great accomodations guarantee that we will be back  ,0.0528169,0.02758216,positive,0,0,5,5

loved it the treasure hunt was really good fun my husband and i stayed at the royal palms for a few days and we really enjoyed our stay we have never been to arizona before and we didn t know what to expect the resort has a spanish feel with lovely foundtains and gardens the room suite was spacious and nice though the bathroom was quite small in comparison the pool was small but it was nice enough and we didn t have any problem getting the sunbeds we also tried the spa which was plesant though nothing spectacular the best part of the resort was activites that went on and the service we were encouraged to play the treasure hunt game and every staff was very helpful in directing us giving us hints we also did stargazing with a huge telescope in the garden which was quite amazing overall we thought the royal palms was a real gem it is not a huge luxurious resort with golf course and 6 swimming pools but it is a relaxing and boutiqueish resort with very good service and amenities ,0.07553476,0.023395723,positive,5,0,4,5
no place to hang your clothes         my wife and i love this hotel the grounds the staff but not the rooms it s our second visit and we will definately return both of our visits were over easter and both were for a week my title to this review is to hopefully get the attention of someone in royal palms management who can address my only complaint no place to put your clothes at over 400 per night you don t really want to live out of your suitcase but royal palm provides no dresser no chest of drawers only two small one drawer nightstand and no hooks or towel rack in the bathrooms  your towels are rolled and place on the counter  no hook anywhere for your wet bathing suit or pj s or whatever you are wearing while in the bathroom just the cold marble floor the good news on my last visit  4 07 was that we were upgraded to a small suite the bad news is that it must have been a handicaponly room as the bar in the only closet in the space was lowered for wheelchair access  room 313 if my memory serves me correctly  so no long hang ability for the ladies i don t remember if that was the problem in 4 06 but i do remember our room also had no convenient place to put your clothing my wife had to hang her fancy dress on a the drapery rod the grounds and camelback vistas are picture postcard perfect the food service at the pool is fantastic and all you need the pool staff  rick and jose are so good they were the biggest reason we returned again mpj  ,0.03352649,0.02152318,neutral,0,5,2,5
amazing experience we stayed at royal palms for my boyfriend s birthday back in july this year and it was an amazing experience the staff was courteous cheerful and overall very good the pool was closed for renovation during our stay but the rp was offering free shuttle service to the phoenician pool we did not feel like swimming so this did not bother us one bit but i thought it was a nice touch to accomodate those who wanted to swim the alvadora spa was great we had a couples massage and it was worth every penny we left the spa feeling very relaxedthey do a great scalp massage along with the regular swedish massage for no extra charge dinner at t cook s was good but i would not call it exceptional the service was average the last thing that i must share is that i had arranged to have breakfast delivered to our room ahead of time and it arrived promptly however we were due for our spa appointments because we had overslept so i asked if they would reheat our food when we got back from the spa they said they would not do such a thing they recooked our entire breakfast and had it waiting for us hot and fresh when we returned from our spa appointment    for no extra charge awesome   i highly recommend this resort to anyone regardless of age or anything else ,0.05510204,0.033163264,positive,0,5,5,5

birthday getaway in april i took my husband to the royal palms for a birthday getaway from a thmonday i had researched many resorts and had narrowed my choices to the lake austin spa resort and the royal palms the royal palms was clearly a more interesting destination with options outside of the resort that were endless so i chose it i booked through expedia and while the rp was either the most expensive or 2nd most expensive choice in the phx scottsdale area it seemed to be the best fit the descriptions on this site and at the rp website indicated it s small and personal feel and service which was appealing the website won me over with the awards list and the beautiful photos especially those showing it s proximity to camelback mtn i booked the package  air and hotel well in advance at least 4 months and figured i would begin making spa restaurant and excursion reservations about one month out long story short it is very important to call in advance  as soon as you book would be best in order to get your preferred times to dine at t cooks for dinner  breakfast and lunch res not required and especially at the spa the times i had asked for intitially were unavailable even one month in advance also when you speak to someone take their name and then call again a few weeks before your trip to confirm your appts it was all worked out before we arrived and we were welcomed with fabulous service but i felt like most of that was due to my frequent contact beforehand be sure plan ahead if you stay at the rp   your trip will only be worth the expense if you plan each detail so as not to miss out on all of the opportunities and inclusions in staying here the only reasons i did not give this resort a full 5 are although the resort does not claim to be adults only all of the reviews and even the rp website alludes to this we were there during a insurance broker s conference and many brokers had brought their children with them while this was only a minor issue it is worth noting that at a resort with a pool area that is so intimate children s voices  even joyful ones carry and tend to interfere slightly with the romantic and peaceful atmosphere even when you book ahead of time the charges in the spa are a never the same as what you saw online or were quoted and b always seemingly random  literally as if the numbers were simply drawn from a lottery and way overpriced check your bill carefully if you speak to someone in charge they will correct the bill but it will be time consuming the spa is fabulous and while i am willing to pay 500 a night for a room paying more than 150 for a very standard 60 minute massage is ridiculous thinking that i would have been disappointed with only one day at the spa i booked two mornings full of spa activities and services on the 2nd and 4th days of our stay if i could do it all over again i would simply ask for the 90 minute massage  confirm the price in writing ahead of time and leave the spa treatments to that this was worth every penny the 60 minute massage and manicure were overpriced and not nearly relaxing or enjoyable enough to justify the price i found myself anxious the entire time i should have been enjoying these treatments b c i knew that i was spending hundreds of dollars on something that had less than 100 of value to me on the last day we stayed a motley crew of people that looked as if they belonged in a trashy music video took over the pool they ordered grey goose and champagne as if it were going out of style  beginning before noon and played their loud music and smoked their cigarettes while dancing their scantily clad bodies around the pool they even brought their yapper of a dog to run around wildly and bother the guests while these folks obviously had paid  on credit no doubt for the two cabanas they inhabited it didn t matter b c the size of the pool and area were only modestly larger than a large residential pool please also keep in mind that the past few days  while many children had been present were quite peaceful and the pool had only been visited by folks with similar interests  sunbathing having maybe 1 or 2 drinks and lunch and enjoyng the peaceful and romantic atmosphere  while rick was fab by asking them to keep quiet and not physically invade the other guest s space there was nothing he could do but keep bringing them their drinks and grin and bear it needless to say we did not stay at the pool more than 5 minutes on our last day which was disappointing i am not sure how the rp could have prevented this occurance but i am shocked that those sorts of people chose the rp for their party it certainly was not a good match thanks are deserved the special touches at the rp are what makes it worth the cost while you could stay at the bellagio for less no one there will remember your name which pool chair you like or whether you prefer red or white you certainly won t be receiving personally signed notes at the beginnning and end of your stay nor rose petal covered bedding or chocolate covered strawberries as a surprise at turndown the staff was superb and especially gracious and friendly the grounds are beautiful the food and service are great the suite is worth the extra  having the extra room is great for couples with different sleeping habits tips place a personal item on a pool chair early in the morning to get your preferred spot  the sun is strong so be sure to wear sunscreen at all times  be sure to go to camelback mtn for a few hikes the ones recommended in the brochure are great for all levels sunset horsesback riding is highly recommended while the crowd you ll be with for 4 hours isn t the classiest the views are breathtaking go to arizonahorses for one option skip the shopping especially if you live in a more metropolitan area t cooks is as good as any restaurant off site so if i had it to do again i would have dined there each evening i was interested in a more formal meal for informal do a steakhouse or cookout with the horseback riding and be sure to check out pizza bianco the bar bianco and pizza rest are well worth the wait it is such a cute setup on a lovely evening also you ll be right next to the stadium so you can check that out too if you decide to rent a car  which you don t need to do unless you plan to leave the resort more than once per day  def do the convertible we did and did not regret it ,0.038352273,0.03125,neutral,5,5,3,5
breathtaking what a lovely experience we had at the royal palms i have never seen a more beautiful property the air smelled sweet and flowers were blooming everywhere you turned walks through the property led you to discover wonderful little secret gardens and courtyards everywhere it is hard to believe the previous review stating they walked ten minutes to the front desk it doesn t take ten minutes to get anywhere at royal palms yes the pool is small but that was one of the things i loved i hate large overcrowded resort pools with worn chairs and no personal service or ambiance i do understand that some rooms are better than the others but the purpose of darker rooms is to give you a respite from the hot arizona sun it is to give the best of both worlds beautiful bright exterior and cool and calm interiors we all must take some responsibility when we travel and do as much research as possible it is very clear everywhere you read that the hotel restaurant t cooks is well known and reservations are strongly recommended in advance if you are a fan of big trendy resorts with 3 pools and many restaurants with rooms that all look the same then this hotel is not for you but if you are looking for a magical romantic quiet getaway with the grace of a fine european inn then royal palms is the place ,0.07013693,0.03359751,positive,0,5,4,5
windows wouldn t open view of hall and air conditioning machines this is the prettiest horrible hotel i have ever been to possibly the casitas in the old section are what gives it its rating we did not see one our corner plaze suite was big and an extremely long walk through two courtyards  my heart began sinking when i saw the first courtyard i had an idea what we were in for as i saw open windows and the people in the rooms and closed windows along the dark halls i was walking in  the door to our room opened to a large lovely living room with loud admittedly pretty stereo music greeting us all blinds were closed here and in the bedroom which adjoined when i opened them i realized why  the bedroom looked out on the air conditioning system  six huge compressors i tried to open the window  not a chance the living room looked out on a dark hall and blank wall with a table against it to stop the eye those windows didn t open either we were in sunny arizona with no way of breathing the air unless we propped our door open and craned our necks to see some sun and sky when we turned the stereo down we could hear the roar even when we left it on as we did all night there was still a strange highpitched noise we could not obliterate i walked the 10 minute walk back to the front desk with a wonderfully patient bellman working his second job while trying to get a real estate license to ask for a different choice my husband who had just broken his elbow horseback riding waited i was told i had booked the new plaza area i had never been told the difference the only other available room i was told was a deluxe room  no living room which might have been ok with me in exchange for air so we went to look that had a balcony and an opening door overlooking   the parking lot i didn t bother trying other choices actually supposedly there were none there were rooms that looked across a courtyard at other rooms not much of a choice if your room faced the road and the hall the other option your windows did nt open because it would be too noisy we actually could still hear the cars through the fan vent in the bathroom ceiling as mentioned in other letters the pool is too crowded the restaurant was fully booked for dinner when we got there but no one had suggested when i reserved a room that i also reserve for dinner in a way we turned out to be lucky as it was mostly closed in like the rooms i could go on as our daughter and her husband and two sons for whom i had also booked a room had sililarly difficult experiences what did i learn always ask if the windows open just because american express says it s a fine hotel don t believe it don t believe the pictures saving grace our room faced east and a lovely sunrise wakened us ,0.043178968,0.047457565,negative,0,0,2,3
royal palms not our old standby anymore well all good things must come to an end so be our eight year run at the royal palms resort in phoenix we thought about changing our annual hotel destination this year 2006 but decided why change something that has usually been good well we found out why the front desk staff needs some training and they need to learn how to treat a guest who has been a faithful to their hotel for this many return visits first our room choice had been requested for a month prior to our trip   then on the day of arrival a very specific room was asked for and was available only to be given away 5 minutes before we were given our room after we waited all day for the room to be cleaned etc then we were told no roll aways anymore   all of our previous visits we have had one so this was an issue this year   new rule that was a problem since the hotel was sold out for the night we were unable to have beds for all guests in our room then the staff was not accomodating in finding an alternative they offered the ritz which is not a resort spa we had to find our own alternative accomodations at 10 p m friday night and it basically ruined our evening and the next day as we had to check out and move the next day although moving to the phoenician was a pleasant one we have always had problems with the bills being incorrect at royal palms  we did for our one night too  and the pool service they had one nice guy at the rp taking care of the entire pool when they knew they were entirely booked at their hotel he was overworked and a little cranky but we understood his plight we just dont spend that kind of money to relax for a weekend away to be treated so poorly and with such disrespect for our vacation time we will definitely be writing to the royal palms to let them know their returning guests will be no longer   not that they care we will be happy to go to the phoenician where our rooms were large and spacious with superb expediant service in every arena of the hotel they may be a little larger but wow the service there is impeccable p s no maid service was knocking on doors at 830 on a weekend morning at the phoenician like at the royal palms   they need a few lessons on luxury accomodations  as we were checking out of the rp we noticed a lovely older couple who were wondering why they did not have the casita they had reserved 6 months in advance   they were very upset as well   they were heading to the four seasons we will definitely not go back too many other mishaps to list just lots of disappointments ,0.055555556,0.024853801,negative,0,0,0,1

one of the best hotel deals in the country i recently returned from my honeymoon where i stayed two nights at the royal palms and three in a suite about 10 feet from the edge of the grand canyon when i was planning the trip i had assumed that our future memories of this vacation would center around the majesty of the grand canyon and our unique closeness to it  we stayed at the buckey o neill suite the oldest standing structure in the grand canyon area  i was completely wrong while the grand canyon was indeed majestic our enjoyment of this national treasure paled greatly in comparison to our experience at the royal palms i have stayed at a few 5star hotels in the last few years and was expecting similar exemplary service and fine dining my expectations were greatly exceeded the grounds are exquisite  there are many secret gardens waiting to be found and while the hotel had no vacancies when we stayed we almost always felt like we were the only guests  the spa was very high class the rooms were beautifully decorated and modern  with a touch of oldworld style with the fourposter beds  the food at t cook s was excellent  room service was also provided by t cook s  and the service was absolutely incredible the last reviewer described service as lacking he must have been staying at some bizarroworld royal palms every hotel worker i passed greeted me with a smile and a hello  often congratulaing us on our honeymoon  restaurant service and room service were prompt and when we checked out they did express a desire to see us again  as if this really matters at allboy that last reviewer was picky   but beyond this basic 5star treatment the service staff went above and beyond anything i had ever experienced before one example i bookended my trip with the royal palms  one night at the start of the trip and one night at the end after the grand canyon  when we pulled into the royal palms picturesque driveway on the last night not only were we greeted by name by the bellhops but were shown immediately to our room with no need to checkin the royal palms without my asking has upgraded us to a villa  with two private courtyards from a simple casita in addition by our bedside they had given us an additional present  a cd of southwestern music and a letter thanking us for choosing the royal palms for the first night of our honeymoon and for returning they went out of their way to make my honeymoon special this was extremely personalized service at its best i used trip advisor as well as conde nast  royal palms is on the gold list and travel  leisure  rated as one of the top 50 u s hotels and the top hotel in phoenix scottsdale to pick a phoenix scottsdale resort on trip advisor while other resorts have similar overall ratings if you compare the user reviews of the other fivestar hotels to the royal palms you ll notice that reviews for the royal palms are much more overwhelmingly positive i recently discovered the reason why the royal palms was magnificent i can t wait to return ,0.04085689,0.03069788,positive,5,5,5,5

paradise in the desert words can t even begin to describe this lovely bestkeptsecret tucked in the dusty foothills of camelback mountain the royal palms is an oasis of historic palm trees lush gardens vibrant lawns mosaic fountains and reflecting pools the entire experience appeals to all senses   the mourning doves cooing the gentle breeze carrying orange blossom perfume the cool mist from the poolside cabana the decadent food from the exquisitely appointed restaurant and lounge mom and i went for a girls weekend and indulged in alvadora spa treaments  orange blossom body buff and aromatherapy massage  the spa is handsdown  or handson the most decadent soulrefreshing spiritrejuvinating space in which i have ever had the pleasure of lounging it s a study in catering to one s every whim i could go on endlessly about the peppermint towels the plunge pool the private outdoor showers but suffice it to say that we nearly melted in the joy of simply being there the royal palms staff were infinitely helpful and friendly and the turndown service with chocolates was just one of the many nice touches of this special inn we will return again and again and again please don t ever change ,0.054347824,0.025966184,positive,0,0,5,5
very pretty hotel with nice service but average room i just returned from a weekend trip for business at the royal palms i was put in regular room next to the road the room had low ceilings a small bathroom and no water pressure the room was very dark because the main window looked out to the walkway to the other rooms so if you opened your blinds anybody in the hallway could look right in your room truely an awful setup i also requested a king bed but was given two doubles instead the beds were extremely comfortable but i don t like to travel and stay in a bed smaller than mine at home i was told they would move me the next day but never contacted me so i didn t bother to switch the tv was an old zenith 25 inch with a dull picture also the towels were very small for a five star hotel the pool was small and the lounge chairs all occupied you had to wait for the pool guy to find you a chair once somebody left it was a very quite and adult type area and not very good for children on the positive side the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and caring the food at all the functions was great and the grounds are wonderful the lobby is warm and inviting overall a lovely resort but the room was just so dark and depressing i m not sure i would want to stay there again unless i could get a room in another location i ve stayed at most of the other upscale places in scottsdale and the darkness of the room was a real turnoff ,0.055084746,0.042372882,neutral,0,0,1,5

relaxation for the right price the royal palms resort was a restful and relaxing place to stay the grounds were nice during the day and very romantic at night i stayed in one of the deluxe casitas so my room had it s own fireplace the staff was exceedingly polite and extremely helpful the restaurant was outof control fabulous great food there is also interesting art to look at all over the grounds however i was told the hotel had been refurbished by designers and it already felt a little warn and not really 5star caliber  that s why it looks better at night  when compared to the four seasons or st regis the royal palms will likely disappoint also the pictures on the website look better than the real thing the lighting in the bathroom was harsh and the layout of the bed relative to the fireplace was not well thought out what s more some of the bathroom fixtures decor looked tackycheap and outdated the private terraces were not well integrated into the square rooms and seemed odd even ugly the good part is that the royal palms is much cheaper than 5star hotels and that made it less disappointing ,0.06964706,0.04432353,neutral,0,5,3,5
best vacation ever absolutely one of the best hotels we ve ever stayed in originally we planned to stay at the popular phoenician  we ve stayed there before but could not get a reservation when i asked the phoenician reservation clerk for an alternate suggestion he told me about royal palms which is just down the street the royal palms was magnificent  mediteranean style  sumptuous furniture beautiful grounds luxuriously intimate we had a deluxe casita i felt like royalty there i didn t purchase any of the spa services however every day  usually in the morning  i went to the fitness room  towels tv music juices ice water coffee fresh fruit to use the exercise machines then went into the eucalyptus steam room  which was heavenly  one glass wall so you can see outside then the outdoor jacuzzi then the outdoor lounging area by the fireplace  all except for fitness room were separate men  women facilities  no additional charge for any of this  and they give you robe slippers  a locker attendant in the spa showed me all the treatment rooms  they were unbelievable beautiful so even if you don t use them ask to see them breakfast  lunch at t cooks or cabana grille were superb only a little disappointed with dinner at t cooks  service  decor were excellent but portions were very small and plain  also not much selection for vegetarians like us who eat fish although not shellfish  but that is such a minor comment and will absolutely not deter us from visiting again treat yourself and stay at royal palms ,0.050795052,0.030477032,positive,5,2,5,5

below the lowest standards hi folks i was so stupid to not do some research before i booked this travelodge mistake major mistake   let s start at the checkin well i couldn t even park my car in that area because too many parked cars where directly standing in the driveway so i got on the parking lot next to the travelodge when i saw trash like ripped out carpet in the parking lot i thought okay not the best neighborhood seems to be the place where some weirdos drop their trash then i walked over the grass wondering about beer bottles and stuff i didn t even want to see laying around on the grass in front of the travelodge i went up to the check in expecting a huge crowd because of the many parked cars but nobody was in the lobby with the exception of the checkin person who was doing the job of checking me in well that was pretty unenventful and i asked where the parking lot for the travelodge might be turned out i already parked my car on the trashed motel parking lot i got to my room 105 the jacuzzi suite if you are looking for a very scary place to spend halloween that 105 is your room nonsmoking room smelling like an ashtray wall paper missing on the wall electrical wires just laying around cut off i have not figured where they belonged to a bathtub i wouldn t even give my dog a bath in and she is really not picky a ironing board without the iron i guess that makes it a surf board for the poor electrical wires got fixed with some tape instead of getting really fixed if i would have had my kids with me i would have left right away no remote control for tv  well i grew up when the first generation of remote controls were invented maybe that news of the invention didn t get through to the travelodge minor inconvenience no internet access  one reason why i picked that place major problem for me since i run an internet business while looking for a phone to check with front desk what might be the problem i discovered they don t even put a phone in the room so i grabbed the motel information in hope i find some magic information for the internet connection big mistake with the exception of strip joint information most of the pages got ripped out in part next morning i wanted to take a shower being a bit on the taller side i figured out that most motel showers got designed for short people but when i got into the shower  good thing i wear glasses but not under the shower otherwise i would have need a couple of beers to get in there  and turned on the water i was waiting for a splashing noise instead i hear a stronger dripping noise yes the shower was turned on all the way but there was no pressure a light rain in phoenix has more power than that shower finally i only wanted to check out once i got to the front desk the guy working there was busy doing something  let s say freecell or solitaire on the computer he only looked at me with the expression of what do you want  i nicely told him that i would like to check out put down the keys and asked for the name of the manager what do you wantcan you please write me down the full name of the managerchad can you please write the full name downchad the manager his name is chad the manager very unusual name what is his real full namechad hill can you please write it down for metotally annoyed by getting asked to write down the name of the manager he grabbed a piece of paper and wrote down the name i thanked him and left knowing i will never ever stay there i travelled the globe never wrote a complaint before because usually you can arrange somehow but this time it was too much of reason to stay calm to make a long story short avoid this place ,0.03107542,0.060230445,negative,1,0,1,1

forget what i said in an earlier review i wrote a favorable review earlier about this hotel i returned in march of 2006  i was too busy to even think about writing another review so excuse the tardiness  earlier i described the hotel as a  hidden gem that s why i returned  i come to the phx area every march for spring training baseball now it is a rat hole other reviews have described the awful conditions i endured allnight parties with an overnight hotel agent who was either too sleepy or indifferent to my noise complaints  i checked out the following morning all of the descriptions you can read in other reviews are absolutely true  i was shocked at the condition of the hotel upon my return i can only assume not one dime has been invested in the property for maintence and upkeep i also was sickened by the hotel jacuzzi i developed a skin rash 2 days later i lodged a complaint with the az dept of health services  unfortunately as i checked out i told the clerk that the jacuzzi wasn t hot enough  that probably reminded management that they hadn t cleand the tub in weeks of course by the time the azdh inspected they were given a clean bill of health if you want to search you can probably find the complaint on file if you do not want to take me at face value when i praised that hotel earlier i meant what i said at that time the property was a great value for the price i now completely have an opposite view i did contact travelodge and they never returned emails it s obvious why this chain is slowly vanishing as i note their hotel guide gets smaller every years customer service sorry not with travelodge i would only hope this lodge is deleted from the travelodge chain also this hotel is a sister to another travelodge in mesa on the east side of town i did stay there once but that was over 8 years ago i remember the a c broke there the night i stayed and temps that march were soaring to 90 degrees avoid both of these facilities at least the property in east mesa doesn t have prostitutes soliciting you by the way i would not at all describe the neighborhood as a  crime zone  i believe the only such zone in the neighborhood is the hotel itself but yes the area seems to be zoned for  barnyard animals as pets and yes there are more than a few roosters that can be heard that s more comical than  crimeridden  but a night at this hotel is not funny at all shame on travelodge for having their logo on this disgrace ,0.027981171,0.051778242,negative,1,0,1,1

it was okay   my husband and i stayed here not for the golf but for the spa benefits and great corporate rate they gave us it was well located close to malls highways etc once we arrived we were impressed by how well the grounds were kept and how large the complex was beautiful view from our room of the south mountain the pool was clean people who worked there were friendly and professional however there were some issues with noise with thin walls between units also the room we were in had a patio door facing the main driveway  we were on the 2nd floor and the noise from cars and golf carts driving back and forth was a little disturbing especially around the end of the day also the room needed to be refurbished and carpet cleaned i must also reiterate though that the staff was very happy to help and very accomodating when we arrived for an early checkin we were mistakenly given a room that had just been checked out of a few hours prior so everything was a mess however we were offered another room but we said we would wait and we were also given free lunch at the restaurant not too bad a place really even if you don t golf laura from ontario canada  ,0.042777777,0.04,neutral,5,0,0,5

new rulesno bar service for the pool after 6 pm four of us decided to enjoy sunset by the pool with a few margaritas we went to dinner at a local restaurant and arrived at the pool near 6 pm the guys in the group went to get drinks and were directed by the bartender to go to the clubhouse as the pool bar was closing the clubhouse told them that their liquor license did not allow them to serve us drinks to take to the pool i questioned the bartender who was very rude and asked for a manager the manager ryan confirmed that the concession to the restaurant and the pool bar had been sold to different parties effective jan 2006 as a result liquor laws did not allow them to serve liquor in the other location we actually observed the pool staff confiscate someone else s drink later we left the pool and went to the clubhouse for drinks and appetizers karen an excellent waitress indicated that while they could give us drinks in plastic cups to take to our room we shouldn t take them to the pool because they would be taken from us i can t imagine that a resort would expected vacationers not to enjoy a drink by the pool at sunset it is an essential part of the vacation experience for me ,0.026086956,0.034239132,negative,0,0,0,3

not bad but some things that you need to be aware of first off the resort is pretty nice the facilities are very well maintained rooms are not very big walls are very thin the pool is a bit smaller than the pictures depict and is usually a bit of a walk from most rooms  music is a bit loud also  the weird part is were it s built this is no scottsdale  the surrounding neighborhood is a bit rough to say the least with that in mind you would expect there would be a security gate at the entrance but lowandbehold there isn t there are a few resteraunts on baseline road but for the most part your going to have to take a bit of a drive to find a decent place to eat the golf course was the real savior here staff was great course was very well maintained  even considering it was june  and very challenging  ,0.061363637,0.030303031,neutral,3,0,3,5
nice resort we stayed three nights at the legacy the grounds were beautiful well kept we stayed in a one bedroom unit the unit was nice but the walls are thin we could hear our neighbors talking the restaurant was good we ate there for breakfast and dinner we tried on numerous occasions to call the conceirge but no one ever answered when we called the front desk to ask our question she said she didn t know the answer and would transfer us to the conceirge when he answered the phone all he said was ask someone else and hung up i would say that was our only negative experience we had while staying there when we ran out of coffee we walked to the front desk and asked for more and by the time we got back to our unit the coffee was waiting when our toilet became clogged they had someone to our unit within minutes overall we had a great experience at the legacy except for the concierge ,0.037063953,0.015988372,positive,0,4,0,2

legacy customer service is substandard we recently booked a suite at the legacy golf resort in phoenix and had one of the worst customer service experiences that we have ever experienced during our travels upon checkin the staff appeared to have little time to check in the guests that had arrived after waiting in line for approximately half an hour we were told that our room was not ready and there was no clear indication given when it would be ready upon further inquiry including a request to speak to the management we were finally given a room number and told that we could check in when housekeeping was finished cleaning the room the reason given for the delay was that the previous guests had checked out late and the resort had no control over this however as we approached our suite we noticed that several of the other suites were still in the process of being cleaned leading us to believe that the resort was understaffed one of the points made by management while we were booking the suite was the fact that we would love the room and it was worth the wait because we would have a wonderful view of the mountains  golf course from our upper balcony when we were finally able to occupy the room we stepped onto the balcony and had a wonderful view    of two large eucalyptus trees   which totally blocked any other view we have booked suites at this resort several times in the past and are very reluctant to do so in the future because of the poor customer service ,0.034545455,0.023636363,negative,0,0,0,1
longest week of our life we traded a week of timeshare to stay here and what a mistake the customer service was consistently bad however the food was worse the restaurant bar was supposed to close at 10pm but on 2 different nights it closed early our sheets were too short and when we called about housekeeping they offered to deliver sheets but it stopped there we had housekeeping once for the entire week the shower head was like standing under a high pressure washer without any actual hower we were given bad information during checkin about the internet and then when questioned to resolve the issue was told sorry we can t do anything about it overall it was a disappointing resort and i would never recommend it ,0.029069768,0.06395349,negative,0,1,0,1
only fair in reading this review you need to know that we don t golf and aren t too interested in a pool we booked this room because it was the right price for what we thought would be a quiet and relaxing room for a week of shopping in phoenix 1 unless you go to a timeshare presentation you will never know the amenities of the place there is nothing in the roomnot even the restaurant s menubut you will get a voice mail message every morning telling you to come to the concierge desk for your welcome packet the packet has only the family activities for the week and the concierge gives you a hardsell pitch to go to the timeshare presentation we had a pretty full schedule and aren t new to phoenix so didn t want to waste time on the presentation 2 the walls are thin we heard everyone around us and their tvslike a lessthanaverage motel we heard no outside noiseno birds woke us up in the morningbut we did hear the rhythmic creaking of the bedsprings in the room above us 3 it is a pretty propery golf course views are relaxing having a kitchenette is helpful the beds are comfortable and the price is definitely right  we paid 109 for the studio  the concierges seemed to really know phoenix well from what we heard them telling other people if you don t mind hearing your neighbors or go in the offseason it s a decent placejust nothing special ,0.06395349,0.019864341,neutral,4,3,4,2

not for everyone the legacy has the elements of a good resort such as large suites proximity to the airport and new facilities such as the pool the grounds are nicely landscaped overall all the makings of a good destination what lets this place down is the approach taken to guests this is a resort where half the accomodation is owned and half rented to guests it feels like guests were an after thought with a tiny low decor lobby and staff who are pleasant but missing the training and poise of a good resort if you want a big suite  make sure you get a corner room with good basic decor this place is good don t expect lot s of frills  the restaurant is basically a golf snack bar  the neighbourhood is not the best but nothing most of us can t handle just not the upscale feel of scottsdale for example don t expect to find neighbourhood restaurants above mcdonalds or ihop value was good with the old story you get what you pay for good rooms no frills if you really are looking for a resort with full service go elsewhere if it s a big basic room at half or a third the cost of scottsdale resorts you should check out the legacy good luck  ,0.05381166,0.03307175,neutral,4,3,4,4
enjoyed th elegacy golf resort three of us stayed at the legacy golf resort last week in a standard room for our week long golf holiday we were cramped for dough so jammed three of us into the standard room but everything was more than fine the pool was closed while we were there for renos but that s finewe were there to golf and the new pool opened the day we departed and looks real nice the golf course is nice too nothing too special but a good course nonetheless the rooms are nice and clean and very comfortable and they had ample cooking facilities too if you are so inclined to prep your meals etc daily newspaper was a nice treat too the neighborhood is fine the complex is something like 200 acres and is more or less gated and very safe safety was a nonisuse to us despite what one or two folks say about the neighborhood our only minor issue was that we had the front desk fax a document for us and we don t believe it was ever faxed and to make it worse the document was shredded by the office staff who maintained that was the  policy  to say the least we found that a little odd but life rolls on the legacy is real close to sky harbor airport downtown phoenix tempe and virtually everything we d stay there again but wouldn t do any faxing next time  ,0.049899194,0.028225806,positive,5,0,0,4

had a great time with legacy we loved the legacy we stayed there for four nights in early october we had a studio suite room with a golf course view we were on the second floor first of all our room had tons of amenities we had a kitchenette with a microwave two burner stove minifridge toaster coffee maker even a washer and dryer as an earlier reviewer noted the beds are a little on the firm side but i did not find that it inhibited my sleep additionally a young family did check into the adjoining suite during our stay and i did notice noise as a result however i do not think it was enough of a problem to keep me from staying at the legacy again the views of the golf course from our balcony were great and the pool was large and uncrowded with a fun little pool bar the resort practically abuts south mountain park in phoenix and the resort activities staff offered lots of free activities for guests  watercolor painting hiking in the park etc  they also have a fitness room that is complimentary for guests we ate in the resort restaurant and the food was wonderful  i had a creamy rich steak diane  as well we thought our rooms were extremely wellpriced  we booked them through an online booking service and got a great deal  all in all we really enjoyed our stay at the legacy if i were visiting phoenix again i d definitely consider staying there ,0.026819924,0.022988506,positive,5,5,5,5

built in a diverse neighborhood i come to phoenix since i have family there and i have stayed at this resort with a friend who was offered a free stay the resort consists of timeshares and owneroccupied townhouses the timeshares are in one area and the townhouses in another we stayed in a 1st level one room suite it had all the amenities we needed the decoration is nice including the tile floors we were not hassled to attend a presentation the onsite restaurant is very small the pool is off to itself which i like the area is not a ghetto as a reviewer previously wrote it is a very diverse area with different cultures the resort is tucked away off the main street  baseline and is in a residential area with older ranch homes on acres of lands  horses across the way and new home developments the grocery store frys marketplace is a new plaza less than 5 minutes away it includes a target ross starbucks blockbuster the resort is less than 10 minutes ways from south mountain park where me and my friend did some hiking you can also take the car to one of the looking points and see the city lights there is also a horseriding stable at the south mountain park if you want to do a little riding so if you are use to only seeing one type of people then this is not the place for you you will be frighten and scared for no reason like the previous reviewer but if you are use to living in a multicultural area it won t bother you at all ,0.027877698,0.03417266,neutral,3,0,0,0

think twice after having twice been to the legacy we would not go again the first time several things went wrong but we thought perhaps next time things would go more smoothly wrong the first time we were there we discovered that the food in the grill was awful tasteless hamburgers and bland salads further the restaurant allowed people to stand their children on the tables  as an example  there was no hostess and so one could be left waiting for a table for a long time the pool was o k but music blared with grating songs the second time we went the following items went wrong in our room the tub wouldn t drain  they had to come back twice to fix it  the icemaker didn t work  theyfixed it but it still didn t work  the ironing board wouldn t stand up the dryer was broken one wastebasket was broken the beds were made a 400 and the sheets were never tucked in so they came undone in the night we loved their golf course and practise facilities the staff is very friendly and the massage therapists are excellent   that s why we gave it a second chance but there really was too much to overlook to go again ,0.04090909,0.038068183,negative,0,1,0,5

great hotel in a great location i ended up risking a try with priceline for the sydney cbd and ended up getting this hotel for 65 us a night plus taxes based on what i paid the location and the friendliness this was a great place first it s in a great location across from hyde park around the corner from oxford street and about a 10 minute walk to darling harbour i also had no problem getting to the rocks sydney opera house the bridge and the ferry terminals  i think it was about a 20 minute walk however you have access to all the buses on oxford that will take to the rocks and even the bondi beach buses i didn t end up using any of the trains so i couldn t comment on how convenient those are as far as service goes everyone at the front desk especially the concierge were helpful i went solo and had a vague idea of the things i wanted to do so i relied heavily on the concierge to help solidify plans the hotel room is on the smaller side  but not any different than many hotels in major cities it was modern and the bed was comfortable and if you ask for a high floor the view is great it had a small refrigerator stove top microwave and dishes that makes eating in or packing lunches convenient they also have a laundry room in the hotel for 5 au a load  each for the washer and dryer the only real negative i has was the cost of the wireless access  55 cents minute up to a max of 27 for every 24 hours but in doing my research that is not uncommon in australia there are some cafes that have access  most charge  like 23 hour  but some do not it seems like most mcdonalds had free access there is also an iga supermarket about a 5 minute walk away on oxford as well as a post and if you brave oxford street at night there are a ton of eateries open late right around the corner but darling harbour is also close enough for a late night dinner there are also a couple of great eateries down on the corner of stanley and crown streets one cafe i can t recall the name serves great sandwiches for under 5 there are a few sushi places and a bar as well i would definitely stay here again enjoy ,0.035504695,0.036384977,positive,5,0,5,5

a bit expensive the hotel is pretty good the room was spacious and with high speed internet connection the breakfast was very good my only objection for this hotel concerns its pricing policy in the hotel s online description about the rooms it is nowhere stated that highspeed internet is on extra charge  about 25 aud per day i do not remember exactly  furthermore the breakfast was not included in price so this was an extra cost  although they gave me a lower price because i bought 5 breakfasts from the first day  finally allthoygh i had payed the room in advance for 5 days they reserved additional 50aud per day from my credit card just in case of extra expenses  this happened before my decision to buy breakfast and high speed internet access  so if i knew all these before making my reservation at this hotel perhaps i would choose another ,0.056962024,0.025316456,negative,5,0,2,3

loved it i booked this hotel on wotif for a long weekend away with my partner i wasn t expecting much from it but was overly impressed by the room it was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was spacious with an enormous bathtub not a spa but still relaxingthe only downfall was the size of the tv a big flat screen would have been better in the room we didn t have a park view room but our view was still excellent you could see the wharf at woolamooloo and the lights were amazing ,0.060606062,0.0479798,positive,0,0,4,0
don t bother with the executive lounge i booked this hotel through wotif com au for my husbands birthday we chose the executive room with access to the executive lounge the rooms are clean and beds comfortable great location don t bother to book the executive lounge rooms below are the problems  i booked the executive level room and we were placed in room 1706 not on the top 2 floors as stated in the booking when we checked in we were given no information about the executive lounge and had to look it up in the hotel directory we then had to wait 30 minutes for our luggage to be delivered to our room i had to ring to find out where our luggage was we also received no evening turndown on either night nor were there any bathrobes in the room these are all listed items on the hotel website the wesite also states that there is a cooktop and pans in the executive room which was not there during our stay the top level was closed for renovations so no spa pool etc access this should be stated on the website the hotel also states that cocktails are available in the executive lounge this was not the case as there was only one staff member and nowhere set up to have a cocktail made there was also no cutlery set up for the evening canapes or breakfast when we arrived for breakfast at 9am there was a very limited selection left and we were told that was all that was available as breakfast was until 10am the plates should have been replenished with enough selection until 10am when breakfast finished this is an executive lounge in a 5 star hotel and the service was not good enough ,0.020348838,0.024086379,negative,5,2,3,1
as expected i was gonna rate this hotel excellent except for this one thing that bothers me the bed linens and towels did not smell pleasant but smelled like sweat or washed without detergent or dried insufficiently i expect this class of hotel to provide linens and towels that smell beautiful i was also disappointed that there were no bathrobe and slippers in addition the internet was so slow even though it was supposedly high speed the best thing is probably the hyde park view followed by its spacious space large bathtub location and general layout i guess its a good hotel for honeymooners whether to book this hotel again i am not too sure as i am particular about bed linens and towels odor but will surely recommend this hotel to others who are not so fussy about this detail ,0.04609929,0.043439716,neutral,4,0,2,1
great accomodations if you re more than 2 people to this day i remain mystified as to why when travelling outside of north america it is so difficult to find a hotel room that sleeps more than 2 adults aka has 2 double or queen beds in one room as we were three we searched high and low to find such accomodations while in sydney and finally we came across this property the only one that could guarantee a room with 2 double beds not single what do people do when travelling as a family or a group of friends in these places anyway the room was clean modern and very spacious more than comfortable for 3 adults very central walking distance to almost anywhere in downtown sydney the only complaint i do have is that to access the internet from your laptop in the room they want to charge you 30aud   a bit of a rip if you ask me ,0.028374232,0.032208588,neutral,4,0,3,3
nice central hotel nice hotel clean rooms and lobby our room was a large room that overlooked the park nice touches with the flat screen tv in room microwave toaster plates etc we got to check in around 1130 am which was nice the hotel staff were very helpful the only problem was that you can hear everything going on in the halls every door shutting everyone s conversation etc from the room also we didn t know before we checked in that the rooftop jacuzzi and pool would not be working overall a good hotel in the city center ,0.06125,0.02125,positive,0,0,3,4

loved the hotel pure luxury and you pay for it came to sydney australia for a little holiday someplace that i have always wanted to go the first night was spent at the aaron s hotel in the hayward market area a very basic hotel but nice clean and cheap at about 89 the 2nd and 3rd nights were spent at the sydney marriott hotel let me be clear because i was confused at first there are two marriotts in sydney the sydney harbor marriott hotel is the most expensive and located within a 5 minute walk from sydney s popular harbor area i stayed in the sydney marriott hotel which is about a 15 minute walk from the other one it is facing hyde park on college st  i think and is located in the cbd  central business district  the hotel room rates when i checked online were about 200 per night but honestly i used  frequent sleeper points that i had gathered up over the years experience i was upgraded to an executive type suite  nice and loved the room it was very large with lcd type television the furnishings looked new and modern the large jacuzzi type tub was great because i was still recovering from a 14 flight almost 24 hours earlier the staff was courteous knew my name immediately and quite helpful in pointing out points of interest it was a great place to stay for business folks now you want to know if i would have paid the 200 per night for it based on the initial price alone on the web no however now that i ve been there yes i d pay for it next time sorry i didn t take any pictures of it however i did for the aaron hotel review i d recommend it for business travelers because of its location and amenities and folks with a couple of kids because of its location across from that really nice hyde park oh yes i found a thai  i usually don t like thai food restaurant two blocks away the food was fantastic i think it was called  thai princess  thank you ,0.052364863,0.03277027,positive,5,5,5,5

sydney marriott pretty good not perfect just back from one night at the sydney marriott this past week i generally like marriott s so i went in with high expectations first off the location is perfect walk to the train darling harbor and pitt street shopping but our first impression of the service was rough upon pulling into the driveway there was no bellboy to help with our bags we waited a few minutes and i finally went in and had to ask someone from the front desk for help  they promptly came out to help us  maybe we just caught them at a bad time but it didn t seem busy anyway front desk staff was excellent and very friendly the crib we had requested was already in our room when we got there room was pretty good size and the beds were super comfortable we were on the 12th floor with a park view and couldn t hear the traffic outside at all next morning we did the buffet breakfast and again had some spotty service the servers didn t come around too often to refill coffee and the omlet station was only staffed for 5 minutes the entire time we were there also for over 20 adult  if you didn t prepay the night before it was much more expensive i wasn t all that impressed with the buffet some of the fruit was just canned pears and peaches there were no pancakes or waffles i know i sound picky but you try breakfast with two toddlers in tow and no pancakes upon checkout staff was again great and even offered to load up our car for us while we went for lunch so overall pretty good but for the price  330 aud night i wouldn t say it was a great value ,0.06693549,0.025806451,neutral,5,3,2,4
very comfortable well positioned hotel my wife and i stayed at the marriott hotel sydney for two nights in late november 2007 occupying a large deluxe room with two double beds our room overlooked hyde park and provided an excellent view the hotel is well positioned to hyde park and pitt street and is close to public transport the monorail and numerous restaurants at 171 per night  excluding breakfasts  i think that we got a good deal our room was exceptionally quiet with no noise from street traffic or from other guests lifts arrived promptly on our floor and were never crowded all features of our room were in good working order and were well maintained and we particularly enjoyed the feather pillows our check in and check out were prompt and staff at reception were very pleasant we are from country victoria and seldom visit sydney but should that occasion arise again we would not hesitate to return to this hotel ,0.05792683,0.033536587,positive,5,0,5,5

loved the view i have just stayed in the sydney marriot for 2 nights it has a prime location next to hyde park and just around the corner from oxford street george street is only a short walk away too i had a room overlooking the park and i loved the view it was such a beautiful view to wake up to watching the sun set at night was also beautiful i would definately request a park view if possible the room itself was okay a ittle dated with scratched desk my bedside lamp did not work  but may have just been the bulb the bathroom was spacious enough although lighting was a little subdued and i would have preferred it to be a little brighter for shaving unfortunately the shower was a you have to stand in the bathtub  type which must be problemamatic for people with restricted mobility as you either had to step into the bath which involved a step of at least 10 inches or onto a step at the side of the bath which itself was over 6 inches and then step over and into the bath itself really silly design the bed was very comfortable indeed with lots of comfy pillows the tv was the usual tv in a box type but with lots of channels small sofa was nice but looked like it needed either a good clean or reupholstered lots of storage space and minisafe breakfast was included in my deal and was buffet in style over all the food was very average and definately not worth the 31per person if you did not have it included in your deal the view from the window was lovely though    directly opposite the park my only negatives about the hotel was in regards to housekeeping i returned on a saturday evening after a very busy day to find that my room had not been cleaned i had just bought some hot food to enjoy but instead had to wait over 30 minutes for my room to be cleaned the staff were apologetic but after a long day it was not the best way to start the evening overall a grreat location and wonderful view from room room itself was adequate but dated bathroom was large but i would prefer a seperate shower or no bath would i stay again probably but ony if a park view ,0.044840295,0.03808354,neutral,5,2,4,3

pleasant and comfortable we booked on priceline for us127 night and stayed for five nights in august in a room with two double beds which accommodated our family comfortably check in was friendly and relaxed  we made no use of the dining facilities or bar the room was truly spacious with a kitchenette  sink microwave kettle toaster and a fridge which was largely filled with minibar items  which we didn t use  it would have been great just to have an empty fridge  the bathroom was generously supplied with towels and pleasant lemonbalm scented toiletries a ridiculously large triangular bath  so much for conserving water and a well functioning shower the safe didn t work but we didn t pursue it we had a lovely view of hyde park no problem with noise a well adjustable heating cooling system the location is brilliant just around the corner from oxford street across the park from the museum train stop and plenty of food shops nearby  including a big cole s in the world tower  the 23d floor terrace has workout machines a fine jacuzzi and a cool pool  too cool for swimming in august with great views over the city would we stay again definitely ,0.054577466,0.024061034,positive,5,0,4,5

good hotel with some flaws this hotel is located in central sydney on hyde park next to oxford street my room was large and with a nice panoramic view over east sydney the bad was comfortable broadband internet access in the room costs aud 29 per day  too much in my opinion the bathroom was ok it had a huge bathtub but the lightning was really bad and there was no heating which made the bathroom terribly cold if you didn t leave the door open during the day service was friendly but not perfect i found a piece of plastic in my musli at breakfast one day and on my complaint the headwaitress just took the plate away  no excuse or offer to bring me a new plate the breakfast restaurant is also too small for the size of the hotel people had to queue for 2030 minutes to get a table on sunday the hotel has a small gym with two treadmills one stepper one stationary bike and a multipurpose weight station the good thing is that it is open 24 hours but it could be a bit bigger for my taste ,0.039540816,0.039540816,negative,5,3,3,2
sydney marriot  a great place to stay we have just returned from a 2 night stay at the marriott which we enjoyed immensely our premier room was on the 10th floor and we were amazed at how little street noise penetrated  it was really good the room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean we found all the staff members we encountered to be friendly and efficient we ate lunch in the restaurant one day and it was excellent breakfast was also good except for the really awful tea and coffee which has been mentioned in an earlier report our package included breakfast both days and valet parking and was such good value we will certainly be back ,0.069327734,0.024159664,positive,4,3,3,5

great experience at the sydney marriott during a holiday period i stayed at this marriott on dec 30 and 31 2006 amazingly with no hotel rooms available in the city on new year s eve i was able to get this 5star property on dec 31 for marriott rewards points  so if you re looking for a new year s eve hotel room next year and have marriott points to use      my 14th floor room had a nice city view over to the mountains and a huge triangular soaking tub  not whirlpool spa but it was the size of the typical spa tubs found in marriotts in the us  i found it to be a great retreat from the bustle of the downtown sydney cbd  central business district  hyde park is across the street the hotel has a rooftop pool which when i was there was generally not crowded it s near the museum cityrail underground train station and a 2030 minute walk from the restaurants and shops at darling harbor staff were very friendly as someone else mentioned the concierge service during my stay was top notch up there with the best i ve ever experienced in a hotel  the other great experiences were also in marriotts and this is largely why i prefer the brand  in particular mark was very helpful to me internet costs an amazing 24 95 day aud you re probably better off using one of the 5 halfhour public machines in the business center or getting out of the hotel to use an even less expensive internet cafe  they re plentiful in sydney unless you need the security of a personal connection on your personal notebook full breakfast  hot cold was 32 aud which isn t the greatest value in the world but seemed in line with most meal pricing in sydney since marriott breakfast buffets are good fuel for a busy day of touring or work even if it s a bit much i recommend it they were also nice enough to store most of my luggage for a few extra days between checkout and my departure from australia while i visited with a friend who lived on one of the northern beaches i ll definitely stay there again when visiting sydney and i recommend this property to others ,0.0371875,0.02375,positive,5,3,4,5
fabulous experience strange bathroom marriott has yet one more reason for an excellent reputation of service and quality this hotel is between a 4 5 star but without a doubt service is a 5 the employees at this hotel are fabulous and will do whatevers asked or not we were unfortunate enough to have a party member fall extremly ill and needed a thermometer immediatly and the concierge offered to run home and get theirs if they could not locate a pharmacy they also handled our kids mistakes and calls at all ours of the day with extreme grace and understanding the hotel was impecably clean and in a quiet location the way the bathroom is shaped is the strangest we have ever seen and not up to typical marriott standards but is encased in marble anyways regardless the shower is steaming hot and controllable nice place with great staff ,0.05176,0.04324,positive,5,0,4,5

an ok finish to our holiday although we expected better stayed at the marriott circular quay as a last minute splashout for our last evening on holiday we were in room 2201 which was touted as a room with opera house view this was true but you had to be in the smallish window looking far to the left to see it otherwise it was a great view over the city and part of the harbour pros very well located in the heart of cbd at circular quay very clean rooms with modern pleasant decor good shower and bath excellent fluffy bed and high quality linens great breakfast bar with a huge selection staff were very helpful and concerned however      the cons the staff also seemed to be completely unorganized and a bit flustered with handling the continuous influx of clients  this is an enourmous hotel conference center and everything that this implies   the car valet area was always very busy and the wait was always long they lost our car keys  incorrectly tagged at one point but did hustle to remedy the situation for us this room  2201 is not recommended due to its location near the elevators   the hall noises were very loud and clear although the walls were wellinsulated and we never had noise from neighbors overall with a few minor snaffoos it was a nice place to stay however if you are seeking perfection or an incredible end to your holiday i d recommend finding something else ,0.055608366,0.031844106,neutral,4,3,4,3
exceeded my expectations location the hotel is located quite centrally on pitt st about a seven minute walk to pitt st mall and a two minute walk to circular quay  near the opera house and the rocks  the closest train station would be circular quay and the next one after that would be wynyard the room we stayed in a standard room with city views and a king size bed the dcor was surprisingly nice and quite stately the bed was extremely comfortable and there are some nice black and white framed photographs of the harbour bridge there is inroom broadband internet access at 9 95 hour or 19 95 24 consecutive hours there is also an inroom safe and tea and coffee making facilities the tv wasn flat screen although there was a wide selection of cable channels available there is also an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe the bathroom was also very clean and included a hair dryer it was wellstocked with products from the romatherapybrand and there was shampoo conditioner shower gel and moisturiser  all with lemongrass as well as facial soap and body soap it was impressive that the marriott is environmentally conscious like other hotels and allows guests to select whether they like to have their linen and towels changed daily by indicating so with a card placed on the bed etc service checkin was very fast and the front desk staff were friendly i found that the concierge on the particular night that we stayed didn seem to keen to help however the marriott has an t your servicebutton on the phone so you no longer have to amenities there is a relatively large gym with free weights weighted equipment treadmills bikes rowing machines etc but the equipment is rather outdated and the gym provides a water fountain but not bottled water for free there is also a pool and a spa as well as a sauna i believe there is a business centre but we never used it inroom dining the 35 head breakfast price is outrageous so we didn actually eat breakfast here we did however have inroom dining the hotel has a policy that the room service is free if it takes more than 45 minutes to deliver we ordered room service and were told that it would be about 30 minutes it arrived after 17 minutes which is quite impressive the quality of the food was very good albeit expensive ,0.038855422,0.029216867,positive,5,4,4,5

irritated by the bad service and duplicate charges yesterday was our wedding day it was a perfect day until we checked into the marriott on circular quay we live in sydney so we had booked into the marriott as a treat for our wedding night we had booked through another website so we had paid in advance when we were checking in we were in our wedding clothes so the receptionist was very nice to us and even said he would send up a complimentary bottle of wine to celebrate the wedding he also offered us a late check out of 1pm we headed up to our room which was pretty basic we called room service and asked for some bath robes so that when we returned from our wedding dinner we could change out of our formal clothes after about an hour we went to dinnerthe bath robes had still not arrived after we returned from dinner we checked for the bathrobes as i was dying to take off my corset and wedding dress no bathrobes so my  new  husband called down and asked for them again we were told they had already been delivered we checked the whole roomno sign of them to this the person on the phone sighed and responded that they had been delivered but he would send the guy up with two more and that it may take a while as the guy who delivers robes was busy eventually as we were about to fall asleep the robes were delivered the robe guy was pretty apologetic and said that he had delivered the robes to the room next door earlier by accident there were also a number of other problemsthe cold water was not running in the sink so the only choice for hand washing was hot water only which was uncomfortably hot of course we never received our complimentary bottle of wine and we just checked our bank account and they have charged us a second time for the hotel room i m not sure why they charged us again as when my husband checked out there was no outstanding charges on the bill i called to see what the charge was for and before i could even explain the situation a very rude lady told me i would have to contact accounts when they open at 9am tomorrow so yes i don t think i would recommend the marriott and we definitely will not be using this chain again we were expecting a great experience from a 5 star hotel we have had much better experiences in other hotels ,0.037015945,0.03359909,negative,4,1,1,1

overpriced and not up to usual marriott we are frequent marriott users and were very disappointed the standard room was small and could have been any 4 star hotel the worst thing was the service though because we were sightseeing we got back late a few nights and ate in the bar the food took forever to come and was a very limited menu and not good nor hot when it came it was almost impossible to get a waiter to take our order for drinks and my husband ended up every night going to the bar and getting them himself cocktails are very overpriced small and not very good seafood buffet was good though location of hotel great though we highly reccommend a nearby chinese restaurant to eat  you turn out of the hotel to the right and go up an escalator in the next building along to the first floor it looks like you are going into an office block but it s there the food is wonderful as evidenced by the number of chinese eating there also if you go in the door before its a well hidden small shopping mall adn you can get away from the bustle of sydney in a courtyard and get a coffee sandwich pastry or go to the chemist or newsagent we are huge marriott fans but this hotel was a great dissappointment  ,0.044527896,0.03165236,negative,5,1,1,1
overpriced but in a great location first of all the location is just fantastic and in all honesty that s what you re paying for because at 140 a night  without breakfast   the overall quality of the rooms doesn t justify it it was mid winter in sydney and our room was always a bit cool even with the ac set to 30c    and it was also disappointingly small in comparison to rooms we ve had at various mandarin orientals and hyatts reception and concierge are helpful but we booked an early check in but did not recieve it but we were given a courtesy room we stayed here for four nights at the beginning of our 3 week trip and when we came back to sydney to fly back to the uk we stayed at the rendevous stafford in the rocks which was about half the price and our room was twice as good  complete with well equipped kitchenette and breakfast was included we would not stay at the marriot again if the rendevous had rooms ,0.039402176,0.01834239,neutral,5,3,2,3

mixed feelings about hotel i stayed in the hotel on 21 june 2008 i was a bit disappointed because i originally booked  through the marriott website a nonsmoking king bed room we checked in very early on 21 june and our room was not ready so we came back late in the peace when we came back to the hotel we were given a double bed smoking room i was extremely disappointed with this as i specifically asked that my preference would be a nonsmoking room double bed but i got smoking i had previously stayed at the marriott in victoria canada in 2007 and was very impressed with the facilities and location unfortunately with these expectations in mind i was expecting that the sydney harbourside marriott would be the same  unfortunately it wasn t as good i do have to say that the marriott in victoria was recently renovated in the last year but the harbourside marriott has not been and i saw this in the room for those who were thinking of staying in a opera house room  i stayed in one of these rooms on the 19th floor  it is not quite what you think you can see the opera house but the view is seen through in between 2 buildings to the left and right of the window  you don t have a 180 degree view which looks directly onto the opera house  if that makes any sense  also your room faces east so when you go and open the blinds in the morning the sun comes directly into your room face and blinds you i do not recall seeing in the room a usb port  which i saw at the victoria marriott which would have been handy to charge an ipod  for example  the reason why i m posting this post is because of something that happened on the evening of 21 june which i was a bit concerned about i went down to the health club on saturday evening around 7pm firstly the spa was empty and did not have any water in it  was covered up  so if you have expectations of having a spa in the winter at this marriott forget it secondly for those who have children and were thinking about using the pool the pool does not have a shallow depth for you to stand on  i was planning to do some aqua exercises and couldn t because i m short and couldn t touch the bottom of the swimming pool without my head being submerged   the pool is 1 4 metres deep all the way around nice pool despite this finally the biggest concern for me was that i was there for 40 minutes and the health club in that time was not manned i was appalled because of the swimming pool and the dangers of children drowning  too bad no one was there to save you if you drowned also there are lockers but at the time i was there there was no keys for the lockers so you could use them i went to the desk and because it wasn t manned i couldn t get help the sauna was very nice i must admit  though it was not steaming when i was there  it was nice and hot   with the bvlgari pack you get you only get one soap bar bath salts and something else for one person  not for 2 people  we also didn t have bathrobes in our room so that was a bit sad finally the buffet breakfast is good  on the whole  the fruit was very sweet and nice  given the fact that it is winter in sydney  don t go at 10am  we had to queue for 10 minutes before getting a table i forgot to mention  the location is excellent  2 minutes walk from the airport train and circular quay loved the location of the hotel you pay for the location though walking distance to many things ,0.033225574,0.039152298,negative,5,0,1,2

ok business hotel  not bad but you can do better having seen how highly this hotel scores on trip advisor i m left feeling that some other reviewers could have a career as wine critics   i travel a lot and stay in a lot of business hotels around asia this hotel doesn t cut it as a 5 star hotel it perhaps just scrapes through as a 4 star but more realistically it s a 3 and a half there is nothing dramatic to fault it s just old and tired and the service is hit  miss yes the rooms are clean and if you are lucky you get a good view of the harbour  the opera house  but you would also get this at any of the many highrise hotels at this end of town  and yes the location is good if you are a tourist or if you work at the north end of the cbd  otherwise only average  there is an avis desk with available cars at the hotel which is very convenient but the bathroom is small basic and dated a minimal update some time recently didn t really disguise this the air conditioning is noisy and still has a notveryaccurate dial on the wall as it s controller the furniture  fixtures show plenty of signs of a tough life no doubt if you stay here you will be comfortable enough but don t expect 5 star standard and for this money there are better options ,0.04855769,0.0375,negative,0,0,2,2

great location great views we spent three nights at this hotel in april 2008 we paid extra for a room with a view of the opera house however as the hotel is down one of the side streets we weren expecting much of a view we were pleasantly surprised great view from the side window of our 27th floor room we caught the train to circular quay from the airport for around 16 per person it was much less hassle than catching a cab through traffic on a friday afternoon and we were in our hotel room within 45 minutes of our plane landing the hotel staff were very friendly and efficient the room was comfortable and quiet with everything you need  good shower bath tub lots of pillows  the room service menu is extensive  and expensive and our food took 45 minutes to arrive the food was okay as far as room service goes the hotel is very close to cafe sydney in the customs house  we could actually see the restaurant from our room  we had an excellent dinner there and would highly recommend it  although make sure you book well in advance  there is a convenience store straight across the road from the hotel although prices are not marked on anything it is more reasonable than the convenience shop down at circular quay and has a good range of things the hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the mall and main shopping area we paid about 10 to catch a cab to the powerhouse museum we would definitely stay at this hotel again ,0.04590909,0.027727272,positive,5,3,5,5
wonderful stayed there in april on a special package deal offered by the hotel and advertised in the age newspaper it included a double room with city views breakfasts and free valet parking  unsually costly in the centre of sydney  we were given a room with a great views of the bridge and harbour which was wonderful the location is also great  a short walk to the rocks circular quay restaurants and the gardens our only complaints were that we were charged for one breakfast each day which was odd as there was two of us staying there this was quickly sorted at checkout and no charge was made to us another hiccup was the rudeness of the valet parking attendant who was very rude and condescending however the checkin and room staff were extremely helpful and friendly and professional overall i would certainly stay there again ,0.038333334,0.028333334,positive,0,5,5,5

excellent sydney harbour location i stayed at this property 3 1 083 14 08 for business the hotel rooms were very spacious with nice bathrooms a robe a small hotel bar refrigerator coffee maker and safe the showers were excellent  plenty of hot water and excellent water pressure the gym was okay with several treadmills stairclimbers stationary bikes and machines to work the legs and arms however they did not have any machines that worked the abs something needed after all of the seafood that i consumed pool area looked nice but i didn t actually use the pool the hotel location was perfect for the central business district and walking to the office was very easy the hotel is also half a block from the circular quay bus stops and ferry dock  excellent we took buses to bondi beach and watson s bay and the ferriy to manly beach back to food  there are also plenty of restaurants near the hotel including a wonderful italian restaurant right next door the hotel also has a phenomenal seafood buffet available nightly with expanded offerings on the weekend i went during the week and had my fill of crab legs jumbo prawns and many other excellent dishes including multiple minidesserts the lobby bar area offers live music wednesday  saturday the wednesday night piano jazz singer john harkins a chicago native made my stay that much more enjoyable  have a nice club sandwich some tiramisu and a drink and sit back and enjoy the music the staff in the lobby bar were also outstanding  very attentive and friendly not overbearing the only draw back of the hotel was the lack of wireless internet in the rooms  i took my laptop to the lobby to use the wireless access this is expensive on a daily basis but for 24 actual hours of use at 24 95 this option was very reasonable for a 2 week stay concierge staff was also very good  recommended good restaurants a phenomenal tour to the blue mountains and a place to get my eyeglasses fixed replaced they also sold calling cards for the us  very convenient and reasonable would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel for business and leisure had a great time in part due to the very good service that i experienced from the room attendants front desk conceirge and lobby bar staff ps  for those arriving early in the am they have a lounge where you can relax and freshen up shower after the long flight from the east coast  a nice touch ,0.06320862,0.028061224,positive,55,5,5,5

great rooms bad service stayed here for 3 nights in march the room we got was great view of the opera house an old englishstyle building good furnishings  except a little wear and tear showing on the bathroom ceiling  the hotel s location is pretty good too but the service was really lacking i was staying with a friend who didn t have a credit card and didn t speak that much english but would arrive at the hotel several hours before me i called the hotel a week early to tell them the situation gave them my credit card and gave them my marriott rewards number  i m  silver elite in their book  i then called them again about 3 days before my stay asking some logistical questions about getting to the hotel and asked them again if my credit card marriott rewards number were on file they said no and took them down again promising that there would be no problems for my friend to check in when my friend arrive to check in they treated her horribly they denied having the credit card forced to put up a hefty cash deposit barred her from making phone calls from the room etc etc when i showed up and told the front desk what happened they were unsympathetic and the thing that really gets me is that they had my marriott rewards number on file that means that someone did get the credit card number over the phone but that they lost ittwice   of course i need to watch my credit card number very carefully for fraud now all in all we made the most of our stay enjoyed sydney and the room and avoided the front desk like the plague we checked into the grace hotel a few blocks away a few days later and had far better service and more modern room  with a worse view  ,0.029137615,0.038522936,negative,4,0,3,1

excellent this was our first hotel in australia the preordered limo whisked us in no time to the hotel after the 20 hour flight we felt like arriving in a haven of tranquility a hotel like this is just what you want after such a trip sure this is no designer or  boutique hotel but it is everything a good solid luxury hotel should be our room  executive suite was superbly comfortable with off course the wonderful marriott bed and a good view of the harbour and opera house from this prime position we watched the qm2 and qe2 glide into sydney harbour we took breakfast and evening drinks in the executive lounge which made us feel very privileged in our room we had wireless internet acces my husband needed medical attention during our stay this was organized with a minimum of hassle every staff member we had dealings with was courteous and efficient i recommand this hotel and when i visit sydney again i will certainly stay here again ,0.058139537,0.030523255,positive,4,4,4,5
great location but a bit tired great location just off sydney harbour but the hotel is a bit tired and in need of refurbishment we found service poor and were kept waiting for rooms after the 3 00pm check in time be warned about the lift situation they are being refurbished and one of them is permanently out of action this means at peak times you can be kept waiting for 15 minutes or more and when you do get one they are scarily packed we liked the look of the observatory ,0.046195652,0.038043477,neutral,5,0,3,2

location location location as expected this is a nice hotel with very knowledgable and friendly staff there are stunning views of the opera house bridge and all the boating activity for me it s the location that really made it worth the price aside from the views it s an easy walk to the hubs for ferries buses and the city trains  a car will only cost you a lot of money to park and infinite frustration with driving in a major city you really won t need it  the rocks  nearby hip area always has something going on or if you want something a bit more serene take a walk through the nearby botanical gardens or just cruise on the ferries this was our base of operaton while we toured the area we stayed at the marriott 3 times with side trips in between they were awesome about keeping bags for our shorter trip so we didn t need to be bogged down with the extra baggage the staff was helpful knowledgable and responsive each of the 3 rooms we stayed in had the same flaw the carpet was wet near the refrigerator we ran into one of the facility engineers who confirmed my suspicion when the refrigerator goes through a defrost cycle the accumulated ice melts runs to the bottom of the refrigerator then out into the cabinet and onto the floor in each room we used handtowels to soak up the dampness and remind us to avoid walking on the spot  the engineer noted that the staff intentionally runs the defrost cycle at the end of each guest s stay to keep the refrigerators looking good and are supposed to put a towel down to catch the moisture but     really quite irritating and no one seemed to understand what we were talking about when we called down to the front desk we also had a problem with our bill for our first stay we were given a smoking room but  per our request and based on our booking were moved to a nonsmoking room which was a little smaller and not quite the same stunning view and although the desk staff stated that breakfast was included  confirming our reservation we were mistakenly charged for breakfast it required talking to the manager to reduce the bill to reflect the correct amount  a concession for the smaller room and removal of the breakfast charges  annoying but at least it was fixed overall the location and pleasant staff compensated for the annoyances i d stay here again ,0.039009113,0.035307515,positive,5,4,4,5

just something missing     our night here was booked as part of my 30th birthday and although there is nothing to fault it wasn t quite what we expected from a 5 star the rooms in the hotel are strangely shaped  we had 2 rooms and one was more oddly shaped than the other and i assume this is to take in the fantasic views of the harbour that the harbour view rooms have the rooms at the back are like many city centre in that the look over rooftops and alleys one of the rooms we had had a seperate shower and bath while the other was combined one of the rooms had bathrobes and the other the slippers the rooms are not as large as the other sydney hotels we stayed in on our trip and neither were the bathrooms the rooms although recently refurbished didn t feel like 5 star the breakfast was extensive although would have been expensive if it was not included in the nightly rate there are however an abundance of cafes locally offering excellent value breakfasts the hotel is located almost opposite circular quay and has onsite parking although it is 35 per night one word of warning would be to make sure you are not in the rooms that are opposite the lifts we were thankful we weren t in these rooms as they were the first we have ever seen facing the lifts which i imagine could have made them slightly noisy we would probably stay here again but at a100 per night more than the grace hotel it would need to be on offer ,0.041467626,0.03272302,neutral,4,3,3,4
3 stars maybe 5 stars definitely not i have not stayed in a hotel that was more undeserving of its rating there is nothing 5star about the accommodations appearance and service associated with this hotel my wife and i had reserved a club room with harbor view the room was very small and cramped and had a view facing the city opposite the harbor they made us wait til the following day to switch rooms and when they did switch us they switched us to another room with an almost identical view of the city at that point we just accepted the room the concierge staff was hit or miss one of the gentleman was genuinely helpful the other two we interacted with seemed aloof and apathetic probably the most annoying thing about the entire stay is the elevators i don t know how or why but there are 5 elevators in the hotel each time we attempted to ascend or descend the wait for an elevator was unbelievably long i am not sure why this was but it was strange other random notes the food was descent the workout facilities were acceptable the spa massage area was cold and sterile if you can get a good price on this hotel and book accommodations with expectations of a 3star property i d recommend it if you are expecting a true 5star experience i d keep looking ,0.04184322,0.037605934,negative,0,3,1,2
nice place to stay we booked this hotel and got the revive package which included two bottles of wine  a bath pack upon the day of stay they were a little busy when we arrived so the driveway attendent asked if we wanted to take our own bags to our room its a nice hotel and was good value for money  we paid 33900 per night and that included a buffett breakfast  parking in the price the room was medium size but the bed is wonderful we had the best sleep and shutters to close over the windows which makes sleeping in a breeze as it is as dark as night you dont get much of a view so if you want to see a view this is not your hotel the rooms are clean  nicely furnished  although we did notice coffee had been split over the wall near the bathroom  not cleaned  we stayed in room 1019 we also had to ring them and remind them to send up our revive pack but that was about it  which they did in about 10 minutesnice place to stay  well priced  good servicei am a fussy person and have stayed and some lavish hotels and this is nice  clean although the bathroom is a little small  small bath towels as well ,0.05172414,0.011853448,positive,4,0,4,5

this hotel is a zoo the only great thing about this hotel  and it is amazing  is the location it is literally a stone s throw from the main ferries and the transportation area i chose this hotel because we were arriving  10a internationally with two small children and they have an early arrival lounge the whole hotel is packeda complete zoo elevators full eartoear long lines to talk to the front desk etc  the early arrival lounge is a joke  a vinyl couch with three people on it and a jar of mentos one bathroom with the single toilet and shower inside i emailed the conceirge twice before departure asking for an early check in because of the kids and they still could not swing it we were forced to riffle through our bags in front of everyone in the lounge and shower change or lose our first whole day in sydney the actual rooms are very cramped and nothing great but adequate the buffet breakfast is beautiful we also stayed at the shangri la and it was twice as nice and less expensive although a little farther walk from the ferries also received my invoice back in the states and a few extra charges appeared on my bill which has not been easy to retify ,0.034346845,0.02759009,negative,5,4,2,3

must try harder  having stayed at other marriot in sydney and brisbane i was a little disapointed with the harbour marriott the plus first though the location is fantastic  just across the road from cicular quay however we did feel that this hotel is almost too big we had neumerous problems with contacing  at your service  we reqested a sydney telegraph daily but this request was not met and we were told could not be as the hotel did not stock this local paper yet they could get international papers  the bed was very uncomfortable and hard and the bath room in particular was very small the staff we found were not particulary freindly either  this is in comparison to other marriott  but we spent very little time in the hotel and it certainly was a clean hotel and felt very safe it is however expensive and if you do nt mind a bit of a walk i would recomend the sydney marriott on hyde park out of the 2 marriott in central sydney  ,0.04903315,0.042127073,negative,5,0,2,2

great base for intro to sydney there are quite a few contradictory reports on this hotel many of the comments are true but for a first visit to the city i think it is a great base the location within easy walking distance of circular quay opera house the rocks and even downtown shopping makes a three or four day visit very easy city tour and bondi explorer busses start their route a few steps from the marriott and there is a taxi rank right outside the hotel add to this the most comfortable beds excellent housekeeping and a reasonably quiet location and you have an almost ideal hotel i say almost since as many others have pointed out the restaurant or bar is best avoided unless desperate there are many excellent eateries nearby such as city extra on circular quay for breakfast and doyle s or quayside brasserie for dinner one of the best locations in the city without paying the earth ,0.054447852,0.04447853,positive,5,5,5,5

honeymooning at the sydney harbour marriott i stayed here for nine days for my honeymoon no problem checking in at 8am our room was spacious and on the 26th floor with views of the opera house the beds are great almost like the heavenly beds at the westins only problem with the rooms were the lack of drawers to put our clothes in no worries though we called their at your service desk and asked if they could bring up additional hangers and we received them within 10 minutes the fist day we ate the buffet breakfast at the hotel that was the first and last time we ate at the hotel the service in the restaurant was poor and it was totally overpriced we didn t use the pool or the hot tub because it looked like it hadn t been used in months once again no worries we went to manly and bondi beaches instead we didn t use their spa either they have three massage rooms that were very cold feeling and uninviting and were right off of the work out area on the flip side the concierge was great they booked tours for us told us the best places to eat in town and gave us directions on how to get to some of the top tourist attractions  manly beach taranga zoo  food try the big breakfast at city extra right by where you catch the ferries pizza tia pina at the rocks chinese east end by the ferries on the walk way towards the opera house fish and chips rouge on manly beach things to do do the harbour bridge climb the tour of the opera house the blue mountains featherdale wildlife park tour and take the ferry to the taronga zoo if you only have time to go to one beach bypass bondi and go to manly do the five minute walk to the botanical gardens this is a walking town and the marriott is in the middle of everything bring comfortable shoes and have fun exploring we surely did i am very happy that we chose sydney for our honeymoon and the sydney harbour marriott as the place to stay     ,0.03895664,0.022357723,positive,5,0,5,5

great hotel shame about the staff we stayed at the sydney harbour marriott for a few days in march booked using marriott reward points for 4 nights closer to the trip we added an extra night but explained that we wouldn t be arriving until early the next morning  landed at about 6 am and wanted to get straight into our room after the long trip from the uk  got to the hotel and the fact that we had booked for one night and were only just arriving caused them no end of confusion we had phone messages every day because they couldn t find the reservation with the points on on one occasion they also couldn t manage to switch off the message light so we had this flashing all night  or until we unplugged the phone  other than fairly useless staff you could have been in any big chain hotel anywhere in the world it was clean comfortable and characterless but we only wanted a city base so weren t bothered about that wouldn t bother paying the upgrade charge for the harbour view i imagined a glorious view of the whole sweep of sydney harbour with the opera house what we got was a view of the opera house in between other tower blocks  really not worth bothering with didn t have brekkie included in the deal and there are loads of places you can get a good breakfast for half the price of the marriott don t bother paying for brekkie unless you really want to pig out at the buffet i would class this as a characterless hotel great location and okay as a central base for exploring sydney ,0.034602076,0.04282007,negative,5,1,1,1

a poke in the eye for the best western chain hmmm where do i start well how about the main reception area is staffed but that is it the other areas are sparse for staff reception staff reminded me of a monty python skit about to start rooms were ok fairly clean but def not thoroughly we found someone else s food in our fridge yuk     cleaning staff were not consistent never knew when they were coming if at all guess you could label them reactive rather than proactive they have a coffee shop adjacent to their lobby but it closes way too early you have to go out and walk a ways to get something to eat or drink now having said the above stuff it is very close to many attractions bus stops and touristy areas close to banks and post office would we stay there again i doubt it we found many other alternatives later on that made stellar not so stellar ok in a pinch but shop around ,0.046875,0.029829545,negative,4,0,2,1
beware of elevator noise in some rooms    and thin walls we ve actually stayed in this hotel twice this year it has a great location is very clean and all round could be such a great place   if it wasn t for that elevator this time we spent a sleepless first night on the 6th floor and the noise from the elevator was unbelievable due to the hotel s location guests obviously come and go a lot and late at night which shouldn t be a problem  but if the elevator makes this whooshing sound every time it moves believe me it can drive you insane the next morning the staff was very helpful to give us another room on the third floor  where we still heard the elevator but it was better i noticed another reviewer mentioned the lift noise before me and the hotel management replied that the problem of intermittent noise from the elevator would be fixed by september  08 as of end of november this obviously was not the case generally the walls in this hotel are thin and you will hear your neighbors conversations and every time the  heavy bathroom doors slam shut due to the noise problems we will not stay in this hotel again  a shame really because otherwise it has all the ingredients to be a nice little hotel ,0.03744726,0.03744726,negative,5,0,0,5
would stay here again in a heartbeat we decided on hotel stellar as the place to stay while celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and were very pleased arriving at about 7 30am off the night flight from perth the receptionist directed us to a small bathroom where we could freshen up before storing our bags prior to checkin checkin went smoothly we had booked through an online site and there were no hassles the room was large and very well maintained there was a small kitchenette with refrigerator microwave tea and coffee making facilities  with bonus coffee plunger and real coffee  plates cutlery etc the bathroom was spotless no views but we weren t there for the views in the lobby area was a number of internet pcs available for a small daily fee as well as a sitting area with couches tv books and magazines etc the staff were fantastic and quick to assist with any request on our anniversary night it was pouring with rain and the taxi we had called for to take us to the theatre had not arrived without hestitaiton the receptionist grabbed an umbrella and went out into the rain to the main cross road and brought back a taxi unknown to us our daughter had contacted the hotel and asked for champagne and swiss chocolates to be delivered to our room on our anniversary which they arranged for a delightful surprise we found the hotel was a reasonable walk from many of the places we wanted to visit in the central part of sydney and close to the train for everywhere else in fact we arrived and left on the train from the nearby museum station we didn t have any qualms walking around at night admittedly this was midweek so perhaps the clubbers were at home again perhaps due to being midweek the night club in the hotel posed no problems for us one of us is a very light sleeper and had no issues with noise the only thing that did disappoint was the paucity of room service meals due to the rain we decided to stay in for dinner one evening and could not get a meal delivered so we tried room service unfortunately they did not have an inhouse kitchen so our choices were a lavash wrap sandwich or a microwaved lasagne the evening receptionist was very apologetic and said this situation was being reviewed so it may have changed by now we felt the stellar was indeed stellar and would have no hesitation in staying there should we visit sydney again ,0.03678161,0.022988506,positive,4,5,5,5
noisy hotel sketchy area very disappointed with my stay here read the reviews and thought this was a safe bet i must have missed the review which mentioned the night club below reception paper thin walls and floor ceilings i have been listening to the 4  guys in the next room getting ready to go out for 1 hour now i thought the rate was okay for sydney but i would pay more to stay in a more upscale hotel location is good if you want easy access to the dodgy party district not great if you are simply a tourist who wants to feel safe walking around the streets and have easy access to the opera house harbour rocks etc ,0.06454918,0.04918033,negative,1,0,3,1

not too bad we booked a two night stay over the weekend at hotel stellar we stayed on the 5th floor overlooking the liverpool and wentworth st junctions thank god for the double glazed windows that kept the majority of the traffic noise out however we found most of the noise came from inside the hotel with a noisy elevator and paper thin walls making it pretty hard to get a good nights sleep the room we stayed in was great it was big nicely renovated and clean pros great location very close to spice i am  great little thai place down the bottom of wentworth st  trains and oxford st shopping partying strip clean rooms with great facilities  foxtel microwave kettle toaster etc cons noise from elevator and other guests  ,0.04197761,0.06436567,neutral,5,0,0,5
will stay again for sure arrived home yesterday after a few days at hotel stellar the hotel is a must for its location value for money and character we were suprised at how large the room was and it was great being fully equipped with a large ensuite great kitchen facilities and ample room to move around and relax we were located on the first floor and i was worried we would get a heap of traffic noise but we didnt as our room was at the back of the hotel the other thing i like was the fact we could open our windows for air staff were friendly and we took use of the car park they offer for 16 50 a night undercover and secure i dont want to complain as i really enjoyed my stay but it did frustrate me that the room had tried to be opened at 8 30 3 times by cleaners as my fellow traveller had checked out earlier that morning and paid and told staff that there was stil someone in the room till checkout time to not disturb i even had the do not disturb sign on the door staff were apologetic but lucky i had the latch on the door otherwise they would of just enetered with me inside by myself i will stay again and you must try it ,0.035869565,0.04347826,positive,5,5,5,3
noisy lift we booked the hotel stellar after reading good reviews when we arrived we had been put right next to the lift which makes a terrible noise and can be heard through the walls i had requested a quiet room in my email when booking it would be obvious to anyone that this was not a quiet room as they were fully booked we had to find another hotel to stay at we booked weeks in advance and so were disappointed that they had not taken into account my request for a quiet room on the plus side the staff were helpful and polite when we cancelled our stay ,0.04431818,0.056818184,negative,0,0,0,5
lots of character a great location to visit sydney from   a somewhat reno d hotel that had all the comforts of home a small kitchen a great shower and three twin beds we stayed in a triple on the top  6th floor near the elevator this way the only complaint we could make during our stay the noise from the elevator was enough to wake us in the morning we didn t go to bed early enough for it to be a problem in the evening even with our room facing the street there was very little street noise the lift seemed to be really the only issue i think that being at the top floor may have been the reason   the staff were great they looked after our bags when we arrived early before checkin they helped contact tour companies and taxis and they locked up our bags when we had a late flight out they were great bartenders at happy hour just allround more than eager to please the internet was very reasonably priced and lots of terminals there is a coffee shop next door so during the week the customers of the coffee shop use the internet as well still seems to be enough for all coffee shop is closed on sunday  we enjoyed the fact that it was a little bit older and seemed to have a bit of character to it its a small personable place where the staff make you feel appreciated ,0.03937008,0.016240157,positive,5,0,4,5

loved this small hotel we travelled to australia in november 2007 from canada and stayed 4 nights at the best western hotel stellar in sydney prior to taking the 28day around australia cruise we had read the reviews on trip advisor and can only add that they were accurate the stellar is a very well appointed small boutique hotel centrally located  we could walk downtown sydney in 20 minutes near bus stops walking distance to railway station  train to airport and restaurants the rooms are spacious with kitchenette which we didn t need but it would be a good feature for someone staying longer the bathroom were all marble and tiles and quite large the room and bathroom were very clean and new looking the staff was very helpful and courteous there is a locker room off the lobby for storing luggage if needed and reasonably priced internet access in the lobby a small cafeteria adjacent to the lobby  not own by the hotel was excellent for a light breakfast lovely very reasonably priced small hotel that we would recommend highly a winner in a city that is rather expensive otherwise ,0.0753866,0.025773196,positive,5,0,4,5
just ok very average hotel the room was a good size but a bit dark the kitchen area was spacious but not well furnished the lobby area and hallways were a bit seedy the best part of the hotel was a fairly good location and the cafe attached to the lobby great coffee and good breakfast it was ok for the money but i wouldn t go back ,0.0882353,0.03125,neutral,4,0,3,0
great location nice hotel didnt really have any expectations for this city hotel but it was great excellent location  dont do what we did and take a taxi from the central station to the hotel  your quicker walking it  get the map out  due to one way streets and all that jazz right at the bottom of hyde park so instant and easy access to the city centre room was a fair size  nice and comfortable  cooking facilities consisted of a hob kettle microwave and toaster so made sure we were fed and watered coz to be honest we found it pretty hard to get anything decent to eat in the city as one of us is vegetarian  could not find the hard rock cafe for luv nor money      bathroom was very clean and nice  even had a wee heater which was good coz it was pretty cold when we were there we were on the top floor   no views as such unless you look sideways up to hyde park but to be honest  who cares reception were nice and friendly  one gentleman in particular  he was either scandanavian or european seemed to be there all the time  think he had a bed in the back but he tried so hard to help with any queries cheers so yes  recommended ,0.06614583,0.034375,positive,5,3,5,5

great location we stayed three nights at the stellar recently we arrived early and were pleased to be able to check into our room straight away the female receptionist was very nice and very accommodating the room was facing wentworth ave but had double windows so we didnt hear as much traffic noise as we thought we would the room itself was nicely done out in modern colours and spacious and clean  the bed was super comfortable too  the bathroom was fantastic and large and the water pressure was great  could have done with more than one bar of soap though  it was nice to have the kitchen facilities to make a cup of tea or whatever the hotel itself was within walking distance of the city  about 1015 minutes  we also walked to the paddington market one morning and that took about half an hour we ate most nights on oxford street as there are heaps of cheap eateries along there the only complaint i would have about our room  and it is minor would be the poor television reception but we werent there to watch t v we had breakfast once in the green light lounge and at 9 a head it was reasonably cheap and you could eat all you wanted all in all i would recommend stellar ,0.043311402,0.025219299,positive,5,4,4,5

unbelievably insulting concierge   hotel was conveniently located we stayed for 8 days hall way constantly smelt of urine rooms were newly refurbished and hence excellent showers were however far too weak the whole stay was ruined by a remarkable incident on the last day when we had returned to pick up our luggage  we checked out a m   the receptionist pavol when i requested to have our luggage back held up a miniture bottle of whiskey and asked me to explain it  it had been emptied and clear liquid put in its place  i understood the implication and told him that it was nt us and that we had nt used the mini bar at all during our stay to my astonishment he repeated the accusation at this point i took exception and again repeated that we didnt touch the mini bar and that his insistance was rude and offensive at this point i thought he would back down but amazingly in very sarcastic tones he repeated the accusation   well at 45 years old  and having travelled extensivley with business and pleasure and also being in the customer service business i was astounded at the audacity of pavol i confess that i got very angry and shouted at him that  having paid over 2800 to settle my bill would i really want to cheat them out of 5 also surely i would of done a better job and put tea colour liquid in the bottle my taxi came and i left shaking with anger we had spent three weeks in sydney and  up to that point  had had an excellent experience what a great shame i have written twice to the hotel but i suspect that my letters are being intercepted as i have still not received a reply from hte general manager a reply has come back and they say that pavol has been a long standing and good employee i leave you to draw your own conclusions i think this hotel relies on its location for its business i certainly dont think its due to its customer care thankyou ,0.046016484,0.046016484,negative,4,0,1,1

disappointed w the roosevelt i was looking forward to my stay at the roosevelt for a business conference i was attending the location on hollywood blvd  is ideal with plenty going on around the hotel the room they initially gave me had an interesting style  an urban efficiency apartment feel to it as i walked through  intentionally dimly lit hallways with carpeting that mimmicked a brick road the room had a brick wall interior  still dimly lit by design  hardwood floors and a pavement like  concrete floor in the bathroom the problem was the noise there wasn t necessarily that much noise but because of the  extremely poor soundproofing of the rooms    you could hear very clearly every detail of the conversations in the rooms next to you it was as if you were sharing a cabin with people you didn t know when i called the front desk to ask to have my room changed   they  played naive about it but i sensed this was a common complaint with guests in that they quickly ended the charade and gave me a more conventional room in a different section of the building that room was indeed quieter but very very small personally i m alright with that when i opened the door and walked into the new room there were two staff members  not housecleaning that had shocked looks on their faces  guilty looks  they immediately hung up the room phone and bolted out of my room i was kind of ticked and called to make sure there were no charges against my room bill because there was limited shelf space and closet space the housekeeping crew accidently knocked my shaving kit into the toilet when they were cleaning rather than fess up to it they quietyly put it back in it s original location that evening when i got back to the room i reached in and noticed the thing was saturated with all of my toiletries wet  and items saturated there was construction going on on the  street lobby level so guests needed to take the  only one operating elevator down to the ground level and hike back up a set steps to get outside i know each of these issues sound minor and random but my general feeling is that for the price they charge per room you should expect good customer service and attention to details at a minimum a reasonably quiet room would seem like a fair expectation i wouldn t recommend the roosevelt   not for the prices they charge i m probably going to try the renaissance the next time i m in the area i don t expect everything to be perfect  i just want a clean and quiet room to stay in with minimal interruptions i did not get that ,0.035969388,0.04234694,negative,4,0,0,2

great location we chose the roosevelt for its location   directly opposite manns chinese theatre and a stone s throw from the metro this was a great decision as we only had two days in la  the hotel was well placed for all the local attractions we booked directly with the hotel but on arrival ended up with one of the smallest rooms next to the elevators after 4 hours we decided to ask for another room as the noise was unbearable this posed no problems and we were promptly moved  luckily to a bigger room away from the elevators  despite this mishap the hotel had a lot of character   it was very dark but this only added to it s appeal we ate in 25 degrees   and had a tasty burger lunch  good value  service  room service was pricey  for breakfast we a ate at mels diner round the corner opposite the metro  fab retro place open 24 hrs  the hotel had some nice touches e g the kiehls products in the bathroom a turn down service at night and little bottles of mms left on your pillow the only other down side was the bathroom  small but perfectly formed i d stay here again  but only for a couple of nights  ,0.041484717,0.03220524,positive,4,4,3,4

don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,0.03888889,0.047569446,negative,4,0,1,1

abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,0.02747678,0.032120742,negative,0,0,0,1

luxury hotel but only for sound sleepers  poor soundproofing hotel is full of contradictions as far as having some excellent features such as topnotch furnishings and very helpful and knowledgeable concierge yet having some serious downsides  including just about the worst soundproofing this frequent traveler has ever encountered doorways opening and closing the hotel elevator  at some distance from my room  and adjacent room s guest making his selection from his closet  you could hear hangers sliding across the bar were all plainly audible at first i thought the hallway revelry was due to some particularly unruly guests and then realized that poor soundproofing was at the heart of the problem as merely closing a door somewhere down the hall sounded like slamming another strange contradiction  the bedding is obviously very highend but relatively hard  i e it s a futon so it s great for those who think firm beds are better and a tough go if you like soft beds a major plus  the location could not be better within easy walking distance of outstanding shopping and dining it is ideal for those who like to be able to enjoy city amenities on foot rather than always having to drive if you are a very sound sleeper i d say this hotel is a great choice but if you favor a quiet rest i would recommend against it ,0.0625,0.05882353,neutral,4,0,0,2

a little out of the way for me this hotel was booked on the recommendation of my travel agent i must say i was a little disappointed  especially with the room they first gave me which was just looking over the main entrance and street i got them to change me to a better room on the other side with a nice view of la still i had paid quite a lot for this place and i think i was expecting a bit more the rooms are average and the bathroom is old fashioned and quite small but the beds are very nice and the toiletries in the bathroom are good the welcome sleep pack is a nice touch though mine was missing the cd  not that that mattered i didnt like the location though it was just that little too far removed from anything i probably would never stay here again but i cant knock the place  if you have a car then this place is ok the staff on reception are very nice too and very helpful however one thing i would watch out for is the hotel car  they charge exhorbitant rates to unwary travellers as i found to my dismay i ended up using cabs s they turned out much cheaper in the end even with traffic ,0.065,0.043333333,neutral,2,0,1,4

don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,0.03888889,0.047569446,negative,4,0,1,1

fivestar staff twostar facility can t say enough about the professionalism and courtesy of the staff from the concierge to the doorman to the housekeeping staff every employee we encountered was exceptionally polite and helpful this greatly enhanced my family s first trip to la as we were concerned beforehand about the city s reputation for snobby and boorish behavior   but there was nothing at all special about the physical condition and amenities of the hotel our room was small and uninspired the common areas seemed uninviting the parking garage is cramped and somewhat dark the location of the hotel was borderline at best  don t be fooled by the beverly hills in the hotel name  in short from a physical perspective the hotel is essentially a belowaverage holiday inn or holiday inn express masquarading as a crowne plaza ,0.058566432,0.03409091,neutral,4,0,0,3

adequate but not inspiring this is not at all a sophiscated hotel  as claimed  its a 3 star hotel this is an ok place to stay adequate for 2 3 nights with clean comfortable rooms somewhere above the level of a motel the breakfasts are pricey not well cooked or presented and certainly not worth the money  denny s diners are not worrying about this place the hotel does have a few professionally well trained staff but the majority are far less experienced  they are however always very helpful  but most of them have spanish as their first language is it me or doesn t la actually have a centre  the nearest we got to seeing one in the evening was the farmers market  there aren t any farmers and it isn t a market  it does have a lot of shops that stay open late and unbelievably for america lots of restaurants quite full even after 8 00 pm  decandance or what   reassuringly they still didn t understand why we ordered a 2nd drink its well worth an evening visit ,0.048828125,0.039713543,neutral,3,0,0,3

roll out the red carpet i can say i truly enjoyed the hotel upon checkin there is a beautiful lobby and vallet service is efficient and friendly  only a few more dollars per night  i would recommend doing the whole vallet thing because the parking garage is a bit of a pain we probably used the vallet service 3 or more times per day of course coming in and out to see all the different area attractions the rooms are just average  used to be a holiday inn although the beds are luxury first good night sleep i d had in awhile no fan in the bathroom no minifridge or wetbar no balcony although there are beautiful views of the beverly hills downtown area i wouldn t recommend walking to rodeo drive you ll need a car in l a there s no complimentary breakfast  you have to be a priority member  the business center came to a convenience although there is a a charge to use it the pool was too cold in october i don t think it s heated but we got drinks from the bar and enjoyed the whirlpool jacuzzi this is a good place to stay for the cost i think we paid 100 per night i would recommend it more for business than pleasure ,0.050555557,0.023333333,positive,4,0,4,4

3 and a half our of 5 i would actually give this hotel a rating 3 and a half if i could overall the hotel is good  slightly above average but nothing spectacular  good value for money though the lobby could do with a redecoration but the rooms are grand  clean modern bright and spacious the staff and friendly and eager to please  we organised a tour to disneyland through them and had no problems we didn t want to drive in la so the location is out of the way from most tourist destination  apart from beverly hills obviously  but it was our choice not to drive so i wouldn t hold this against the hotel if you hired a car and were willing to put up with driving in la you d have no problems hotel is near bus routes to santa monica venice so this was good  although you always get weird looks when you ask how to go anywhere in la by public transport  it s just assumed you re looking for driving directions  on the otherhand the location was good in terms of being nice and quiet at night and away from the madness of hollywood etc also there are lots of good resturants near by within 15 mins walking distance and not that expensive for beverly hills definitely sign up for the priority club as this is what gets you the free breakfast  well worth it ,0.05357143,0.033234127,positive,3,0,4,4

ok but expected more   my husband and i stayed at the hotel for two nights in may 2005 the service was really very good all around the bellhops and concierge were exceptionally helpful in arranging sightseeing tours for us the location is very convenient as others have said but we were disappointed in our room for the the crown plaza brand and price we were paying  which was not as inexpensive as some of the rates ive seen on this review board we expected more the carpet was worn out looking the furniture and decor were holiday inn basic the bathroom looked like it really needed an overhaul the shower curtain was dingy and poorly hung the towels didnt look very clean and were rough and worn out and our air conditioning unit had seen better days i think the hotel rooms should be renovated to maintain integrity with its brand and it wouldnt hurt to increase the temperature on the laundry setting and use some fabric softener i may stay there again but not if i can get a room around the corner at the avalon ,0.043421052,0.041447368,neutral,4,0,0,3
disappointed after driving down from san francisco to la in early january 2004 we were expecting everything the crowne plaza however was disappointing the room was nice but cramped for two people the bed next to the bathroom just managed to allow the door to open but you could hear everything going on in the bathroom so not very private the water wouldn t drain whilst taking a shower so we stood in shampoo soap and conditioner until stepping out we called maintenance up who fixed it but the problem still occurred honestly we couldn t be bothered calling again the use of the internet downstairs in the lobby was good the nightlife on the strip on a thursday night was non existent and very disappointing venice beach fared better the following day ,0.04981203,0.05639098,negative,3,0,0,2
great start to our holiday we stayed at the crowne plaza for 4 nights during a week trip to la the room was booked directly through the hotels website the best price around one bit of advice i can say that we found during booking the room i ticked the box joining the crowne plaza priority points it is free and you collect points for staying towards other free nights we didnt really need this but me being me i like free things anyway we didnt find out until we arrived that ticking that box gave you access to priority bonuses the hotels top floor is reserved for executive rooms but the floor below is reserved for priority members also our room rate did not include breakfast but again being a priority member gave you access to a special members lounge 24hrs which served a free buffet breakfast in the mornings we tried breakfast in the hotels resturant one morning and it was a little basic and expensive the rooms were large and well kept and the only downside was that the aircon was a little noisy staff were friendly and very helpful and maids very very efficiant outside is a taxi rank and bus stop which gets you anywhere you want we didnt rent a car during our stay taxi from the airport was 30 and the buses got us around for the other 4 days no problem the hotel is good for most things in north la we got a taxi to universal studios  35 but took us through some very nice areas and showed us part of hollywood that tours didnt go to if you want to see all of la and universal and disney then i would recommend what we did stay a few nights in north la and a few in south la  anahiem  would definately return to the crowne plaza if staying in la again ,0.042438272,0.023919754,positive,4,3,4,4

luxury hotel but only for sound sleepers  poor soundproofing hotel is full of contradictions as far as having some excellent features such as topnotch furnishings and very helpful and knowledgeable concierge yet having some serious downsides  including just about the worst soundproofing this frequent traveler has ever encountered doorways opening and closing the hotel elevator  at some distance from my room  and adjacent room s guest making his selection from his closet  you could hear hangers sliding across the bar were all plainly audible at first i thought the hallway revelry was due to some particularly unruly guests and then realized that poor soundproofing was at the heart of the problem as merely closing a door somewhere down the hall sounded like slamming another strange contradiction  the bedding is obviously very highend but relatively hard  i e it s a futon so it s great for those who think firm beds are better and a tough go if you like soft beds a major plus  the location could not be better within easy walking distance of outstanding shopping and dining it is ideal for those who like to be able to enjoy city amenities on foot rather than always having to drive if you are a very sound sleeper i d say this hotel is a great choice but if you favor a quiet rest i would recommend against it ,0.0625,0.05882353,neutral,4,0,0,2

brill hotel my daughter grandaughter and myself stayed at this hotel for 11 nights and found the hotel and staff very friendly and helpful as a prority club member we stayed on the 10th floor and the view was amazing day and night we ate in the resturant and had room service and the food was very good and promt the self car parking was very easy and as 3 girls traveling on our own we felt very safe at all times there is a bank with a cash point next to the hotel which gave your balance in sterling which was useful the hotel room was very large with 2 double beds that were very comfortable  there was plenty of pillows and plenty of clean towels the hotel was in a very nice area and easy to get to places of interest the grove shopping is to die for the shops are perfect and the cheesecake factory is a wonderful place to eat  ask to eat on the veranda the views are wonderful overall la is a great place to have a holiday and the crowne plaza beverley hills made the holiday so much more relaxed we we will be staying there again next year cannot wait   ,0.05357143,0.020238096,positive,4,5,0,4
soso property in a location i didn t care for this hotel was okay the room was fine food was belowaverage quality and choices on the menu were narrow and humdrum this matters the neighborhood offers few alternatives for eating and all require driving knowing what you re looking for and parking when you get there i stayed for 4 nights 3 on business and one extra night beverly hills is a place i was doing business so that s why i stayed there i found out that 90210 is not my style  by the way this hotel is technically in century city just over the line from beverly hills  l a has a lot to recommend it in culture and scenery and i found little of that in this part of town although my upperfloor room did offer a city view that was nice the exercise room was cramped and creekity  substandard especially for a hotel in this price class ,0.039634146,0.023628049,neutral,3,2,3,0

don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,0.03888889,0.047569446,negative,4,0,1,1

abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,0.02747678,0.032120742,negative,0,0,0,1

it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,0.04186603,0.03827751,negative,0,3,2,0
okay  nothing special for beverley hills the hotel is in a very quiet area of beverley hills which is probably a good thing but personally i like more activity there are a few cafes and restaurants along from the hotel where we visited for breakfast and dinner after being stung on our first night at the hotel as one of the previous reviewers said they add on the tip to your credit card we also had a waiter knocking on our door asking for us to pay our bill in cash as the credit card hadn t gone through  i ended up paying well over the odds definitely left a bad taste on our first night there the room was average but we did have an amazing view of los angeles rodeo drive is within walking distance nice to visit but not to spend we didn t hire a car but managed to use public transport to get around hollywood santa monica and venice beach venice beach is a must hollywood leaves a lot to be desired but a walk up to the hollywood bowl is nice seemingly the post office along from the hotel is frequently visited by kirk douglas and tom hanks though unfortunately not when we were there ,0.065727696,0.051056337,neutral,4,2,2,3

nice hotel not great tourist area we stayed at the crowne plaza for 2 nights at the end of our world tour the hotel was nice clean and the staff were very friendly we were given a large room on the 7th floor it was surprisingly big with 2 double beds free internet access at 2 computers in the lobby is available tho there is usally a queue the 1 major complaint i have with the hotel is the location there isn t much to do after dark there are a couple of nice places to eat on pico one diner which serves amazing lunch and a pretty pricey restauant both about 5mins walk from the hotel but other than that there s nowhere to hang out rodeo drive is a good 1520min walk and here you ll find some eateries on the way  bring your visa card   we struggled to find places to shop after saving alot of money to go mad here i came home with alot of it also car hire is a must we had been warned of this before but decided that as we were only here for 2 days and were arriving on st patricks day  we re irish so didn t want to be unable to enjoy a drink    anyway we spent a fortune on taxis and i m convinced they went halfway round the world for a short cut so be careful the slight negative thing i would say about the hotel is that we tried to order room service albeit at 10 50 when they stop at 11 but they made no effort to find us an alternative or offer something that takes a few minutes to rustle up other than that no complaints ,0.047083333,0.02875,positive,4,4,3,4
no major complaints but a few minor i stayed here feb 6 and 7 while in los angeles on business my room was on the 7th floor and i found it satisfactory i liked the relaxation c d they provide and used it both nights and it was helpful in allowing me to fall asleep quickly the room was clean and of decent size room service for breakfast the last morning was about 15 minutes late  not a big deal  there is a pleasant lounge with a full bar and comfortable sofas where one can sit have a drink order food or simply read or work the elevators could use replacing but they work there isn t much to do in this area after dark as far as i could tell everything shuts down after dark if you don t want to go to the parking garage get your vehicle and drive somewhere to eat you re pretty much stuck with the hotel restaurant and or room service the food is pretty good but a little overpriced i was here on company business so my expenses were all handled on my corporate account but keep this in mind everybody  staff was helpful and friendly good place to stay for business if you have no other agenda in the evenings ,0.045045044,0.026463963,neutral,3,3,3,3

okay for what you pay this was a very average hotel very small bathroom the hotel is called the crown plaza beverly hills but it s actually in the city limits of los angeles just across the border from beverly hills if you want a clean safe relatively inexpensive place to lay your head this hotel will do the trick you must have a car to get around no public transportion nearby close to hollywood and the sites you cannot have a roll away in your room if there s already two beds in the room they will only allow a roll away if you have a room with a king bed this is important if you have your family and usually get a double with a roll away for an extra 5 you can upgrade your breakfast from the free priority club breakfast to the buffet it s worth the 5 to upgrade unless you only eat fruit and toast for breakfast ,0.040644173,0.01993865,neutral,3,3,3,3

fun good location nice we recently stayed here for 3 days in may 05 and it was great the pool area is not currently under construction the lobby is huge and dark and a great place to hang out and have drinks the rooms are small but very clean and modern it was good to be right in the middle of everything sure the area is filled with tourists but it s a fairly central place to take a cab to anything else if you need to the walls are very thin but that didn t bother us  unfortunately we were not haunted by montgomery clift as is rumored to happen  the only bad thing was the minibar fridge is so small you can t keep any of your own stuff in there and you have to pay for wireless connectivity ,0.04283217,0.039335664,positive,4,0,0,4
cavernous and oldworld this is an ok hotel but it never felt particularly comfortable to me it has a bit of a gloomy cavernous atmosphere  an old but renovated hotel that has a wellfurnished but dim lobby long hallways and a lot of meeting and retail space that seems to be unused the staff seemed pretty erratic and the place lacks adequate signage getting my luggage brought up by the bell staff was unnecessarily difficult and i ended up getting the bags for myself there is a very nice outdoor pool surrounded by a courtyard adjacent to the hotel i also spent a while looking for a phantom fitness room that turned out to be closed but none of the hotel s materials included that key fact overall this is not a place with a tremendous amount of warmth even though it has a good location in the heart of hollywood ,0.034539472,0.06167763,neutral,4,0,0,4
not as great as promised stayed overnite in a junior suite on the 9th floor i ve stayed numerous times at the rennaissance down the way and wanted to give this place a try the hotel location is great the room was spacious and the decor was chic lots of extras very clean however the room is not well insulated and you can hear your neighbors quite well along with the hollywood boulevard traffic that runs all night  people yelling and taxi cabs honking away  the airconditioning heating furnace appliances are extremely loud and go off and on even when the units are turned off we had unplugged the refrigerator thinking that was the noise in the junior suite the bathroom is enlongated with a shower stall at the very end a tub in front of that and then the toilet next to the door the layout was odd and getting into and out of the shower was awkward poor lighting in the bathroom not a restful stay rennaissance way better ,0.041907515,0.05346821,negative,4,0,0,1
very disappointing we stayed here for four days from thanksgiving we selected it based on the reviews on this site but were very disappointed the price is ok but the rooms were not what we thought we were getting we had booked a suite as we were travelling with our two teenage sons the suite is actually only one bedroom with the second bed in the lounge kitchen area we asked for a rollaway bed  as the boys are unwilling to share a bed and were assured that it wouldn t be too cramped we found that it was very cramped the kitchen was very small and did not have a dishwasher and there were no tea towels to dry things the oven seals kept falling off the moment the oven was heated and the oven door did not fully close there were no dishes in which you could put leftover food we were given one room but the moment we walked in we could smell urine so asked to be moved to another room which the staff did the carpet on the floor was dirty  as mentioned in another review  staff did not come in to clean the rooms until around 5pm which meant that we had already arrived back from being out all day and were getting ready for the night s activities getting luggage to the room was difficult one alternative is to carry them up to the third floor or use the lift the lift is only accessible from the road via the garage the garage is locked and had to be opened for us and the lift is extremely small so only 1 large suitcase  we had 4 in total and carry ons as we had been travelling round the world for the previous 6 weeks would fit in meaning a number of trips had to be taken to bring all of the luggage up the staff were courteous and the location is good ,0.03978979,0.031906907,negative,4,1,2,3
great value great location this place is a bit worn around the edges but has great amenities and the value cannot be beat we paid 119 for a one bedroom suite with a kitchen   the oven didn t work but everything else did free parking walk 30 seconds to the hollywood highlands center and about 5 minutes walk to several family friendly options on hollywood blvd which is less scary than it s been in years if you decide to leave the car in the garage you can take the metro to downtown and other locations my only small complaint was that the pool wasn t heated but it was november   so maybe it s only heated seasonally that didn t keep my daugther from swimming it s not the ritz but a very family friendly affordable accomodation ,0.02640845,0.036091547,positive,5,0,5,4

fantastic location and good secure hotel we have just completed a 4 night stay here and were quite impressed with the hotel as most of the reviews state the location is perfect right behind kodak theatre mann chinese theatre  hollywood  highland mall whilst the hotel is not brand new of course if you do your research you already know that before you book the price is reasonable and it is in this brilliant location we had arrived into la early that morning and after picking up our rental car and doing some sightseeing we arrived at the hotel a couple of hours before check in they allowed us to park in the carpark and we had a look through the mall until our room was ready our room was very large with 2 armchairs a separate hallway lead to a large wardrobe and down to the bathroom and there was a separate kitchen with dining table so we were able to have breakfast in the morning before going out the room was also very clean and there was a courtyard off the main area if you wanted to sit outside or you can also sit at tables near the pool area there is also free wifi internet as well my partner and i would certainly recommend this hotel and should we return to la in the future we would definitely stay here ,0.047008548,0.034188036,positive,5,0,5,0

not for me stayed at this hotel for one night in july one night was plenty we got there early and was told that we couldn t check in because the room wasn t ready we could park there though which was good for us the parking is under the hotel and is accessed only by a locked gate the whole place has locks everywhere locks to the garage locks to the front desk locks to the stairwells i wonder how bad it is that they have to lock everything we walked over to hollywood and highland which looks like a new outdoor mall very nice place within minutes of the hotel we then walked hollywood blvd went back to the hotel and was told we could check in went to our room only to find cleaning ladies still there they rushed out of there they only left two towels for four people i had to go find them to get more towels room was just okay it was really big but very outdated it had a weird smell the bed was extremely uncomfortable very lumpy terrible room was as clean as it could be for a very old place the pool was very clean although we didn t use it the worst part about the whole thing is at 530 am you feel like you re at a freight terminal you re right behind the mall so you hear trucks backing up making deliveries unloading of the trucks and trucks ideling while waiting to unload the whole hotel was up by then or so it seemed this place is alright for one night but imo i wouldn t stay here again ,0.045212764,0.039893616,negative,0,0,1,1

an average hotel but what a great location we stayed at the hollywood orchid suites for three days we could park our rental car in the underground parking of the hotel which was very convenient the building looks quite dated as does the lobby but the lady at the front desk was very friendly the room was large and it had a separate fully equiped kitchen with a dining table the funiture and drapes were clean but not very modern in the kitchen there was an unpleasant smell of which we have not been able to determine the cause the reason we chose this hotel was the location in the center of hollywood right behind the kodak theather it proved to be a good choice there are plenty of eateries nearby and after catching a movie at the man chinese theater it is only a five minute stroll to your bed if you re not looking for a very modern hotel but want your hotel to be in a top location chose the hollywood orchid suites ,0.045454547,0.04190341,neutral,5,1,3,4

an apartment in a convenient location we had an executive 2bed suite which had a combined living and sleeping room one separate kitchen and a terrace the apartment is probably 60m2 in total there isn t much walking space in the combined living and sleeping room where there are 2 beds a tv and 2 armchairs the dining table  for 4 people are in the kitchen the kitchen is equipped with the usual kitchen stuff though the only things we used were the coffee machine and kettle there is an aircon as well as a heater in the combined sleeping and living room one point to highlight is that the carpet is rather sticky we walked barefoot in the room and after a while our soles were all black i also killed an unidentified bug in the room but i won t say it s exactly the hotel s fault because when i was walking along the streets outside at night i saw a lot of cockroaches so maybe it s just the general condition of that part of la there is also free internet and printer and paper in the lobby the apartment is located in an area accessible by lots of bus lines and the metro red line we took the metro to chinatown and the buses to sunset strip farmer s market and the grove and the la brea tar pits we were in la again at the last part of our trip and we stayed at another hotel in another part of la while it had been a hassle problemfree stay at orchid suites i probably would try another place or stay with the other hotel that i have stayed at in this trip if i were to revisit la ,0.024152542,0.030932203,neutral,4,0,2,1

location locstion location we stayed 4 nights at this great hotel okay the kitchens were a little dated but clean the size of the rooms were massive we had a two bed suite  i think thats what it was  in the first room there was a superking size bed  an armchair  tv  dinning table and 4 chairs and a complete kitchen all but a washing machineand masses of room then through a short hallway which had 2 sliding mirrored doors which housed the safe and hanging space and shelves also another cupboard with hanging space into a mirrored area with sink and mirrored cabinet on the wall off of this was a toilet and bath with shower over and also another room with a superking bed and mirrored built in wardrobes  2 bedside cabinets and tv this room also had a ceiling fan as well as air con between the first room at the start of the hallway was a hidden sliding door that you could close if privacy was needed  bit detailed i know but when i want info on a place i like to know it all was a very secure hotel with doors locked at night and couldnt get in without your key or the desk clerk letting you in the free wifi in room would have been good if we had bought our laptops but there is a free pc on second floor with a free printer great location 20 yards or so from the mall when you walk through the mall and come out in the open go left and there a great view of the hollywood sign you must try the restaraunt called the grill upstairs in the mall the steaks are to die for also a johnny rockets and other ast food places ,0.032980457,0.022394137,positive,5,0,5,5

great location lovely place having just got off the plane in la we were quite jetlagged and tired but this place was relatively easy to find and there was ample underground parking for our hire car the front desk was courteous and we were very quickly checked in and went to our mini apartment on the first floor although it wasn t a beautiful building the decoration was fine and it was clean and felt safe there was a small pool although it was overshadowed by the many buildings around it and when we went in winter it looked pretty cold the location was amazing  round the corner from the center of hollywood with easy access to the underground trains and the main highways of los angeles only negative points about the location were that it was right next to the back entrance of a large mall  great for easy access but meant we were occasionally disturbed by distribution trucks we booked a selfcatering apartment that came with most basic kitchen items although filters for the coffee maker would have been much appreciated ,0.06081081,0.04391892,positive,5,0,4,4

great location secure parking  70s feel we stayed here for three nights in july we booked it as we were doing a road trip and needed safe secure central parking we booked the two king room suite and were delighted the suite was very large with lots of hanging space the bathroom was clean and more than adequate as was the kitchenette we even had a table and chairs to seat 4 a breakfast bar and still loads of space for cases etc the teak furniture  drapes  coverlets etc were a bit tired and gave the place a distinctly 70 s feel and it smelt a bit musty initially but it was clean and we felt this added to the character of the place overall the pool although small was great fun and a very welcome bonus after a day on your feet trying to get a cab or chancing your arm in a car   the service was friendly and the rooms were cleaned daily  considering its excellent central position and the secure parking which can be extremely costly we considered this place excellent value for moneyand very much enjoyed our stay my only gripe would be that the windows were not particularly secure so we took our valuables with us when we went out ,0.042986427,0.024886878,positive,5,0,4,4

okay but noisy  we are a family of four who stayed at this hotel for 3 nights the positives to this hotel are  location  short walk to the boulevard and right behind major shopping centre    this is also a weakness refer below  free internet large rooms good security  front door access via key or reception clearance  warm pool self contained kitchen  good price for the areaweaknesses to this hotel are  noisy due to location as this is the last hotel at the end of a short street located at the rear of a shopping centre there is a large volume of delivery and truck traffic from early morning if you are a light sleeper you will hear it all  if you have heavy guests on the floor above the noise from the thin floors is accentuated we were kept awake by this for a whole night by people upstairs from us  decor is oldon balance the location of this property and the security were what we required in view of having two kids under 10 would recommend to others but be aware of the possible noise issues particularly with delivery trucks from approx 4 am onwards ,0.033492822,0.03409091,neutral,5,0,3,0

never again the only thing pleasant about this stay was the location the room was a decent size but everything in there was soooo old looking that it was scary the cups and dishes looked like they were rinsed off and put back into the cabinet our microwave looked like it hadn t been cleaned since 1902 eck on top of that the front desk kept calling our room with complaints from people who live in the hotel stating that we were talking too loud    we had to whisper in our room on our vacation unheard of     the front desk called us at exactly 1201 to let us know that it was time for us to check out  duhhhhhhh we were on our way out the door i have been to plenty of hotels and have never had anyone call my room a minute after check out and tell me that it was time to get out rude rude rude sorry but i would rather fork out more money for a nice hotel next time this place was disgusting ,0.026069518,0.052807488,negative,5,0,0,1
this is the one my family of two adults and four kids have stayed in the liberty hotel  hollywood celebrity hotel orchid suites  the old holiday inn  now the renaissanse hotel  on previous holidays in la and we found the orchid suites best by far big clean rooms and positioned right behind graumans hollywood and highland the metro and all the action in the best part of hollywood blvd parking is free and the staff are happy  helpful we had a king suite with 2 king beds and a fold away bed and it was huge it had a seperate bedroom a useable kitchenthat came in very handy we saved a lot by cooking our own breakfast  dinner and a big living area and 2 tv s the suites are a little tired and worn but pluses far and away beat the minuses the hotel is well maintained and clean and has a pool as i mentioned before we stayed at the liberty hotel on a previous trip  found the rooms small cell like  noisey  loud people wandering the hallways at night  and the celebrity hotelalthough our rooms were big ours was smelly and dark my wife swears she woke up and saw a ghost standing in the corner of our room so we were out like a shot the next morning if you want a huge room suite in a perfect part of hollywood and dont want to pay 4 star prices you have found it here i love the place  we are back here mid march 2007    cant wait ,0.03590909,0.03272727,positive,5,0,0,5

wow what a great find  the suite was clean large and everything worked because the hotel is a converted apartment building it had a lot of great things that you don t get in regular hotels such four options of switches in the bathroom fairly sound proof rooms and windows that actually open the bathtubs were equipped with those handy bars for those of us getting older than we d like the beds were very comfortable  with new matresses   the staff was really helpful the maintenance man even gave my family a tour of the suite and made doubly sure everything worked when we checked in the best thing was that the price was what was quoted i e no add ons such as parking fees spa fees internet access entertainment package fees   only the required bed tax  now 14  it was very quiet and unbelieveably close to all the main hollywood attractions my kids begged me to stay here everytime we come to los angeles i am only too happy to grant their request what a great value for my money ,0.044078946,0.026973683,positive,5,0,5,5
cheap   you get what you pay for we decided to stay at the hollywood orchid suites due to the wonderful reviews we read here on trip advisor it was as the reviewer below me explained a converted apartment building the beds as stated were awful one of them even had ripped up sheets on the bed the tubs   same as the other person said   dirty and the skid strips looked nasty  i am wondering if we had the same room or if they are all like this there is a kitchen dont look around too much  you might see the roach motel that is in the bottom cupboard i hated it here i hated hollywood period but this hotel sure didnt help they said that there is a roof top garden  there is   but nothing to write home about i think the cleanest thing here was all the clothes in my bags that never went into any of those drawers this place is convenient cheap and very accesible to all the hollywood things but if you can pick somewhere clean and with more comfortable beds and sans the roach motel   i would do that instead ,0.041466348,0.0625,neutral,4,0,1,0
what a dump yes it is cheap yes it is in a good location but i wish i had paid more at a clean hotel and not felt like i had to wear shoes in the room because i did not want to step on the carpet with my bare feet the widow in the bathroom was caked in dirt and what appeared to be mold the bed was like laying on concrete absolutely horible sleeping conditions i put a towel down in the tub when i took a shower because i didn t want to step on the non skid strips in the tub because they had filth on the side of them yuk fortunately i was only there two nights and could not wait to get out of there my advise    save up your money to stay at a real hotel not some converted apartment building it was a miserable stay ,0.032852564,0.058493588,negative,4,0,1,0
the orchid can t be beat i have to concur with all the other reviews on here this is the best hotel to stay in in hollywood bar none the price is great the rooms are clean and amazingly big and the location is better than anything hollywood has to offer one block to hollywood boulevard and all the attractions there  a locked underground parking lot with passkey and you can access the garage without leaving the hotel my wife and i are going on vacation in two weeks and this will be our second stay here and after trying several different hotels we plan on using the orchid exclusively from now on ,0.049342107,0.048245613,positive,5,0,5,0

okay great location after a bad experience with best western we chose this hotel because our tourist guide recommended it the hotel is located in downtown hollywood right behind the kodak theatre they have their own parking garage which you can open with your room key they have a laundry service too and an elevator we had a junior suite  smallest room on the third floor the room was very spacious because it used to be an appartment building we had a kitchenette too wireless internet didnt work properly we had to sit on the floor right next to the door to have access  but that didnt work all the time  staff was okay but not very friendly the worst thing was the connecting door our neighbours had some kind of party the whole night they had loud music first and then talked so loud and screamed and did some other things i wont mention here best thing about the hotel is the location walking distance to hollywood boulevard is about 2 minutes there is a shopping centre nearby which has restaurants too and live music ,0.054232806,0.033068784,neutral,5,0,3,2
amazing value excellent location we stayed in a deluxe suite from 11th to 14th april 2006 it s an amazing find the rates are great the location is unbelievable it s located in a cul de sac behind highland and hollywood shopping centre  there s a back door so it only takes a minute to get there with a good range of shops and restaurants and also contains the kodak theatre where the oscars are held and the subway is very near by  which was very easy to use and one stop to universal studios  it s on the same block as the chinese theatre with the walk of fame running along it it s also quite close the freeway which made it easy to find and despite the traffic straight forward to get to disney to in just over an hour the area felt very safe and the accomodation had a good level of security there was free underground locked parking and always free spaces the staff were extreamley helpful and let us keep are car there after check out the property is very well maintained and very clean our apartment was very spacious and clean the furniture is very comfortable and well maintained although it might be a bit dated for some peoples tastes  we had a large open plan lounge with sofa bed armchairs dinning table and four chairs kitchen including microwave and a breakfast bar area we had a seperate bedroom with king bed and there was three large wardrobes the bathroom had a shower there were two televisions and a safe in the room there s a laundrette and an outdoor swimming pool we would not hesitate to recommend this to others and certainly would be willing to return ourselves as we were very impressed ,0.06291118,0.030016446,positive,5,0,5,5

great value and location my wife and i attended a seminar in west hollywood their suggested hotels were over 150 00 per night being on a limited budget we searched elsewhere we saw hollywood orchid suites on tripadvisor and decided to try it for about 71 00 per night we were pleasantly surprised the hollywood orchid suites was an old apartment building so each suite has a bedroom which is similar to a normal hotel room and a separate full kitchen the closets were generous and the bathroom was average they had heat in the bathroom and the exhaust fan actually was effective my wife loves that the balcony was nice touch with a table and chairs the hotel was old and dated but very neat and clean the pool was spotless the desk help had no personality but was very helpful and knowledgable of the area and the best route back to the airport i loved the free secure underground parking rain is no problem the location is great if you want to visit the chinese theater you can walk their is no breakfast but pick up some groceries on the way and put them in the full size refrigerator overall it is an excellent value and we would stay their again ,0.045774646,0.028169014,positive,5,0,5,4

another great stay orchid suites continues to be a great bargain in a prime hollywood location i ve stayed here with family members two years in a row and would certainly return rooms are large with  in many cases a wellequipped full kitchen underground parking is safe secure and convenient pool is a pleasant diversion and wellmaintained i noticed a problem with a loose spotlight in the pool this year reported it to the front desk and was impressed to see it fixed in a matter of hours at some hotels that type of problem means closing the pool for days at a stretch the rooftop garden sunning spot is a great place to relax and watch the activity below the only minor problem this year was with a noisy neighbor above us when i mentioned it to the front desk they asked the family to take another room on the first floor problem solved staffers are friendly helpful and wellinformed we left a video cord behind this year and they tracked it down and mailed it to us at no charge overall a great stay and a great bargain i highly recommend it ,0.026282052,0.04551282,positive,5,0,5,5
hotel not so good location great i chose hollywood orchid hotel for the location i thought it was going to be alot better by reading other peoples reviews online not so in my case i was told i would get a room with a view and i got a view of a wall the shower s drain wouldn t stay up so i had to turn off the water to soap up my handicap mother who was with me for mother s day couldn t even use the shower because of this parking underground great but if you leave in the evening you won t be parking in the underground garage when you come back  parking very limited i had a coupon for 65 for 2 beds kitchette they said they couldn t honor the price due to weekend so i had to pay 79  90 total  and still had to give them the coupon for that price the place was old and run down i brought my own sheets and blanket which really helped me deal with this place the only thing good about this place is the location you walk underneath the renaissance hotel and your right at the hollywood blvd outside mall kodak theatre and manns chinese theatre if you don t care where you sleep then here s your place personally i would spend a extra few bucks a get a better hotel the roosevelt is just is close and you can get good deals online stay away from room 302 bad    the indians indonesians that run the hotel are nice but don t give a  if something goes wrong in your room sorry is all you ll get ,0.04051724,0.04051724,negative,5,0,1,1

worst w i ve ever stayed in my wife and i are big fans of w hotels we ve stayed in about 6 different ones my wife was 9 months pregnant so i decided to treat her to a last weekend in a suite at the w in los angeles  needed to stay in la in case she went into labor  we got the spectaular suite and were so disappointed the suite is divided into two rooms making them both pretty small instead of one big suite it was also very dark lastly the artwork and accesories around the room seemed cheap  many cb2 vases and such  definitley not up to w quality it turns out that this w is actually a conversion of an old hotel which is probably a big reason for this w s problems the service was very good but the restaurants were very average and very expensive we ate there the first night and spent 140 despite only having one drink we were pissed as there are lots of restaurants in la we would have love to go to for less than that it seemed like everything there was more expensive than other w s but maybe i m wrong the spa is great and was the highlight for us expensive but a great experience the pool wasn t that great which was a big bummer for my wife the lounges weren t comfortable and the cabanas were a joke lastly for those of you who don t know westwood it is pretty lame not too many good restaurants this location would not be good if you want to walk to good restaurants bars shopping the bars in the hotel are ok but the crowd is not not hip just cheesy if you are visiting la do not stay here lots of other better cheaper better located hotels ,0.061119873,0.043769717,negative,2,2,2,1

building great staff awful we ve stayed here probably 40 nights just this year and so we have a variety of experience here basically i love the location very convient and the hotel design is lovely as is the pool area the rooms are fantastic the service however is horrible they never get your reservations right and we are platinum spg members they also kind of don t do anything but stand around wearing black clothes if design made a four star hotel then this would be one but service is important too they never make the rooms on time and you have to beg them to come if you call for a bellhop be prepared to wait at least an hour as we did last time we also had issues of smoke coming through the floors from smoking rooms into our rooms in three different rooms really an issue and if you are facing the back of the building be prepared to hear all night frat parties from ucla if they had a topnotch staff if would be awesome but they don t ,0.053668477,0.038043477,neutral,0,3,3,3

very unimpressed i was very excited to stay at this hotel but by the end of our stay i could not wait to leave and never stay there again due to numerous service issues the staff at this hotel in literally every department is unable to successfully complete a task you ask of them without screwing something up everything was a challenge for them to get right the pool attendants are never around when you need them and take forever once you have placed your order and don t seem remotely concerned when you ask them 5 times for that drink menu you asked for 30 minutes ago or they messed up your drink order we thought that for a hotel of it s size the pool is completely inadequate and way too small for the number of guests it was literally teeming with children everytime we tried to relax there our room was not very nice and had musty smell to it it felt like no one paid attention to things like chipped paint on all the furniture or burnt out light bulbs in the room i think a great hotel pays attention to those details the majority of the hotel excluding the lobby which is very nice had a run down feeling to it and the hallways on all the floors where dark and musty and personally i thought a little creepy these are just my experiences but i would not bother with this hotel and stay at one of the luxury boutique type hotels where they actually know how to do things right good luck ,0.05083955,0.055037312,negative,0,3,0,2

disgraceful some of the staff were very kind and helpful but this hotel was a complete waste of money the rooms are adequate but the walls are paper thin the traffic noise from outside is terrible  no double glazing and it was especially disappointing to hear the staff cleaning the nextdoor room at midnight with the stereo on fulltilt the pool staff are hilariously bad way too cool to actually do their job and find somewhere for you to sit  prefer to just grunt at people and tell people where they can t sit reading other reviews it seems to be a regular occurrence to close the swimming pool and the bar down for private events leaving nowhere for the guests to go indeed when we stayed there a couple of weeks ago the whole hotel was taken over by a film crew and we were even banished from the lobby  would never go back the w hotel in san diego is decent though  ,0.036676645,0.051646706,negative,5,0,0,4

handy for universal studios but that s all we stayed 3 nights at the beverly garlands holiday inn it was easy to find as just off the freeway it s really close to universal studios and they do lay on a shuttle bus to take you there if you catch the time right that is as we found it sat on the car park most the time and it was quicker to walk as this bus also drops at the metro station  or so we were told we never actually caught it  our room was of the bogstandard variety and did us for the 3 nights its a shame it s so far out of the way we had to catch the metro and buses everyday to do any sight seeing but on the bright side the metro is very cheap and if your doing alot of travelling it s worth getting a day ticket we did have breakfast one morning at the bg and the pancakes  maple syrup were great watch out for the guy standing outside the hotel who wants to sell you tours he caught us the second we walked out of the hotel and before we knew it we where on a 4 hour tour of la and 120 lighter rob who was our tour guide was great and there was only 2 other people on the trip so that was a bonus there are lots of tour companies doing the same routes whether the cheaper ones are as good i just couldn t say ,0.030534351,0.027671756,neutral,0,4,3,4

wonderful in its simplicity excellent frontdesk arrived on july 11th and spent two nights the man at the frontdesk was very helpful and interested in our travel plans we asked for a ground floor room and he offered us one with the least traffic noise although the hotel was fully booked every question we had about los angeles how to get here and there was answered calmly and professionally  the recepion has a drawer with little pieces op paper with the faq of their guests impressive bever seen anything like it the room was ok not too big not small either a little balcony overlooking the parking so little dragging with the suitcases the shuttle for universal studios was very ok regular timings so no need to take a hotel close to universal which are in the middle of nowhere except of course the theme park itself for future visitors who don t want to spend a lot of money on breakfast leave the hotel and turn left just before the traffic lights turn left again and you will see a large ralphs supermarket ,0.04527027,0.025675675,positive,0,0,0,3
pleasantly surprised i booked this hotel for a one night stay using my priority club points this was just a very quick in and out visit from our main las vegas vacation specifically to see stevie wonder at the hollywood bowl  fantastic by the way upon check in the desk clerk upgraded us to a suite as i have a platinum priority club card for a start this doesnt appear to be usual procedure for holiday inn despite what their website says so i was happy with that the room was on the 7th floor and was two rooms knocked into one so was spacious one side contained the bed and bathroom and the other side had a living area and another bathroom  so they could convert back into 2 rooms easily i guess  the  rooms were separated by a wooden lattice panel giving the room a kind of eastern feeling the decor was nice neutral tones and exposed painted brickwork and we had a large plasma screen hanging from the wall on a swivel pole so we could turn it round and watch from either the bedroom or living space the bed was super comfy  to be honest we didnt spend enough time at the hotel to check out any of the dining facilities or pool so i cant comment on them but the room was great the desk clerk was really welcoming and also gave us a bag of free stuff water chocolate etcwe spent our free afternoon at universal city walk and theres a shuttle bus from the hotel that picks up and drops off every hour or so so convenient we ve talked about holidaying in the hollywood area again so would definitely look at staying here again  ,0.034932658,0.031565655,positive,4,3,0,4
not as bad as everyone thinks i stayed at the beverly garland holiday inn starting on july 13th16th 2008 i took the time and read the reviews regarding the hotel and took everything in some people stated on the reviews that the food was horrible and that the area wasn t safe here is an honest review that i hope helps everyone from a frequent hotel traveler the hotel is outdated and is in need of a few face lifts including new carpeting in the hallways the hallways could also use a bit more lighting but it isn t scary the room was clean and came with a coffee maker hairdryer tons of towels  we had 4 adults in our room and an iroining board etc our room was kept clean and we never had a problem we stayed in the eldorado building which if sitting outside on the small balcony  large enough for two people to sit the sound of the freeway is noticeable but once you are inside the room with the airconditioning on you can t even hear it our group didn t have any problem sleeping when we arrived we were asked about taking tours and we simply said that we were there for business so we didn t have timewe weren t asked again and i never felt pressured or pushed to attend a tour we took advantage of the coffee shop and i experienced an okay chai latte but not a big deal we had the breakfast buffet in the morning which costs 11 95 i personally felt that this was a bit steep considering what was offered and felt that if it was around 7 95 that would be betterbut the food was good the eggs were egg beaters but it wasn t terrible the area surrounding the hotel is safe we attended an event about three blocks up and was able to walk back to the hotel at 1100pm without an issue the only issue that i had was that we had to pay for parking now i was only charged 11 00 a day vs the 13 00 i am hearing but i still think that this is ridiculous since i was staying at their hotel and already giving them money via the hotel room this wouldn t make me not stay there again but i would look for a place that maybe didn t charge as much the location is not far from universal studios and there is a shuttle that is offered by the hotel to get you there the shuttle does not pick up at the airportplease keep that in mind when making plans i hope this helps  ,0.020188052,0.034292035,neutral,4,0,1,2
good location we enjoyed out stay at the beverly garland locationthe location of the beverly garland is goodust off the freeway with easy access to disney  took us about an hour but the traffic is crazy  there are a number of hollywood la tours you can book right at the hotel the bus stops at the hotel to pick you up and you really don have to travel far the shuttle to universal is great but when youe returning home at night remember that a ton of other guests will be returning as well and there may not be room for you  which means you wait for the next shuttle  fyi spend the extra  and take the vip tour at universal great value for money and if you don book it you will probably spend your day hating those  and yourself with the vip cards who go right past you in line and who get to get off their trams and explore the sets while you sit on your tram and simply drive by while at the beverly we spent a day at universal a day touring hollywood and a day at santa monica beach  not a bad drive at all considering it is la  rooms no fridge but otherwise fine nice simple accommodation you probably don want a room on the ground floor since these rooms are actually ownstairsand really only have a view of the hill theye built into we started out on the second floor and had sewage back up in the tub  gross but they moved us immediately no problem and ended up on the first floor right near the pool very convenient there is laundry in one of the buildings pool small but nice always loads of loungers snack bar and towels there a hot tub and sauna too but we didn use these food i liked tula the menu had loads of variety and the prices were reasonable concerns my concerns are not so much about the hotel but have more to do with the fact that i booked this hotel because of its review in frommer frommer stated that kids under 12 eat free that didn happen for us and i not sure why was just told that we didn have that package maybe frommer should indicate you have to buy a special package to get this also frommer indicated free parking that also did not happene paid 13 a day i believe minor things i know but these were two reasons i booked here so i was annoyed this is a very pleasant family hotel and a good location from which to sightsee there really not much around the hotel itself  very residential but i would recommend it as a base from which to do universal and see la ,0.04638365,0.041142557,positive,4,4,3,3

a very great experience  we are two young italian sisters and we went to united states alone for the first time on feb 2007 to see the oscar event in real life we decided to stay at beverly garland holiday inn and we had a very nice time there it is not so close to hollywood and you can t reach by walk the most important attraction of the town but with a short walk you can reach the subway that easily take you wherever you want in la and surrounding area  the walk fromto the subway takes about 15 minutes the staff is friendly and help you to do whatever in you for example we had a problem to phone in italy when we arrived and they helped us to show how to do it   they booked all the excurions for us and suggested which places to see the rooms are big with big beds for europen people they were clean and nice to enter in the rooms block you don t need to pass in front of the reception if you don t want they have a separate access and you can enter only with your keycard they have a swimming pool they also have a restaurant very close to it you can reach it in a very short walk they offer breakfast and dinner  the only thing is that the menu was always the same but that s it   beside this restaurant there are not very close places to eat or to shop anyway they also have free shuttle to and from the universal studios anyway we suggest this hotel to people with a car because is very close to the freeway but we had no problems even if we did not have a car so if you don t mind walking from and to the subway it is a nice hotel and then you are in la close to the hotel there are typical houses there is starbucks  not too close and los angeles is simply amazing   ,0.051934097,0.020057306,positive,4,3,3,4

a pleasant surprise i wasn t quite sure what to expect at the beverly garland but it was definitely better than i thought it would be after reading some of the reviews posted here the overall impression that greeted me on arriving was that it was quite dated the reception staff were very helpful and the staff in the gift tour shop were extremely friendly and helpful the room on first impressions was pretty cramped but adequate clean and comfortable we were put in the annex building which overlooked the freeway the noise wasn t a problem unless you left the balcony door open the complimentry wifi connection for my laptop was excellent we had a toilet blockage but the maintenance man was there within 10 minutes to fix it  this was at 10 pm  the restaurant at the front  tula s served some excellent food and had an outdoor area where you could eat  drink when the weather was nice  which we did you could also order room service from here you would definitely need a car if you wanted to go shopping as the nearest mall was about 10 mins away by car and the hotel is a bit isolated unless you are planning to go to universal  the hotel runs a regular free shuttle throughout the day  we were only here for two nights as a stopover travelling from australia new zealand and fiji and we did a tour to tijuana on one day  which is another story  so did not feel the need to hire a car overall it was ok ,0.04790146,0.022810219,neutral,4,3,0,3
noisy not the place to stay if you want to sleep the rooms were well kept they are actually what a holiday inn should look like unfortunately the ajoining door between rooms was the source of major niose the next door neighbors were watching tv all night i wouldn t have made much of it but with thin walls and with an ajoining door we could hear everything the tv was on all last night there i even tried to put a towel under the door it didn t work i was up until 5am the housekeeping service also knocks on the door at 930am when you get less than 5 hours of sleep housekeeping are the last people you want to see also my key cards did not work the second night when i went to the desk they were  fixed but when i tried again only one worked the staff was not overly friendly i had to ask for my rewards perks even though it should say so in the computer the plus of the stay was the lady in the gift shop she knew all about the tours and which would best suite us she even wanted to save us money be prepaired to pay for parking with aaa9 without 11 ,0.034883723,0.04244186,negative,1,0,2,3

wonderful just wonderful i read reviews about this hotel just before leaving the uk and was overall impressed and then read one about the maid service being every 3 days and head lice  what a load of rubbish that is we stayed here for 2 weeks and the hotel room and grounds are spotless the maids come in every single day with fresh clean towels and linen they also hoover up and top up your free coffee etc etc if you have made any brews unlike some of my experiences in spain the maids also will not come into your room if u have put the  do no disturb sign outside your door i had an off day during our holiday and was glad to see they adhere to your requests and dont still insist on coming in also someone said there is not much around the hotel area erm universal studios and city walk is only 7 min walk away to the tram that takes u up the hill the red line metro station is also on route to universal just go left out the hotel left onto ventura and left again across the freeway flyover u will also pass a shopping complex on vineland just before ventura blvd which has everthing u need including a kodak shop incase u run out of camera batteries etc the onsite gift shop prices are very respectable and the lady who works there during the day is superb at helping u if u want to book tours or airport pick ups if u dont fancy the short walk to the metro and universal the 156 metro bus goes to hollywood highland which u can get from across the street from the hotel carpark entrance resturant breakfast is excellent with the only downside being that the buffet unlike other hotels is not free and u have to pay 11 95 per person for it before tipping etc also they have 2 internet computers in the splash lounge which u just put 1 or 5 dollar bills in to gain your desired time u need for surfing ,0.045774646,0.030985916,positive,4,4,3,4
hated the head lice i stayed at this hotel based on its proximity to universal studios and it was cheaper than the sheraton or hilton i was disappointed with the facilities the hotel definitely needs a refurbishment but it did appeared to be clean unfortunate i got head lice from stay notices in the room state that the linen is changed every 3 days unless you request it daily i guess the cleaning staff must be enforcing this rule even if new guests are using the room definitely spoilt what should have been an enjoyable trip to the usa ,0.04657576,0.04559596,negative,3,0,4,3
clean comfortable but getting a little pricey   i ve stayed here numerous times over the last four years in the beginning it was a bit shabby  torn wallpaper mold poor ventilation etc  but you put up with it because it was only 100 to 110 per night now since a change in ownership it s 140  150 per night and parking is up to 11 night the rooms are still a bit dated and uncomfortable the restaurant has improved greatly  though it s menu is limited the bar however is still a disaster bad modern decor it s not friendly or comfortable at all the restaurant staff and the cleaning staff are very friendly the gift shop staff is not the front desk staff run hot and cold it s a convenient place to stay if you don t mind the traffic noise from the hollywood freeway if only they d remodel and refurnish the rooms ,0.03549383,0.059413582,negative,0,3,2,3
dated and nothing nearby          i read a lot of reviews on this hotel and instead of taking heed of what others had said i went ahead anyway we wanted a hotel close enough to the universal studios and not knowing the area opted for this holiday inn thinking the standard must me pretty much the same as others in this chain but found the rooms to be rather dated and a bit musty smelling we arrived on christmas evening were told the restaurant would be serving and providing room service until 8pm when we tried the number it went onto voice mail i left and order which never arrived so my family went to bed hungry as there is nothing within easy walking distance of the hotel however the same restaurant had a lovely breakfast buffet although the children were charged for the buffet but ate free from the breakfast menu a plus factor is that this hotel provides a shuttle to universal studios and is on the pick up route for star line tours and other tours companies so a car is not essential if you opt to stay here we cut our stay short and went to santa monica holiday inn i could kick myself for not basing ourselves there from the outset and doing day trips to universal and for the la tour that we took the staff were pleasant and efficient the shuttle driver prompt and friendly and the restaurant staff good too if you are going to universal there are plenty of hotels much closer with more going on around them and they look less dated than this aged hotel ,0.043133803,0.044894367,negative,0,1,0,3

scary room i stayed at this motel after reading positive reviews on this site overall the room was ok but it was scary because of the lock it looked like someone had tried to break in as there was a deep break in the door where the security latch was in addition the door was loose and would move if you pushed against it even with the double locks in place when i mentioned my concerns i was offered an engineer but because i felt that nothing short of a door replacement would help i decided to wait it out as we were only there for another day i liked the double sinks at the bathroom  this helped tremendously when we were getting dressed to go out the dark hallways and block walls added to the scariness of this hotel not sure that i felt 100 percent safe and would probably not stay here again maid service was also inconsistent and minimal by the way i m not a paranoid type person so it was unusual for me to be scared at this motel ,0.027027028,0.06216216,negative,0,0,0,2
girl from giftshop people from reception every day vry unfriendly  hi everybody i just came back from a holiday trip to los angeles i was on my own i went in total to three different hotels my first hotel was awesome people from the reception were incredibly friendly wanted to help me with everything my second hotel was beverly garland terrible even the manager i have never seen somebody doing so unfriendly to their guests the girl from the giftshop what was she thinking she showed me that she didnt wanted to help me she did this also to other guests and if she arranged something she did everything wrong few examples she arranged a tour for me what wasnt available that day i said that to her    but she said it was confirmed and this was a exception she refused to call the touroperator for me again i went to that touroperator by myself starline tours and i was right  they said that the tour wasnt even available i already paid for it and it was all a waste of time  i lost three very important irreplaceable things in my taxi i asked them to help me and i have waited literal 3 hours in the gift shop she needed three hours to make a phone call to the taxi and believe it or not after all that wasting of time i wanted to see la not the gift shop she called the wrong taxi while i said so many times to her which one it was the reception promised me to call the right one the day i was leaving they still havent done it i have explained my story literal 8 times they were not interested at all  my shower was broken they promised to send someone 5 hours later still nobody have went to my room location is quit isolated some people who have been there are describing it as very quiet well i am describing it as isolated the aircondition is making a lot of noise a nice thing is that every room has a little balcony and also a nice thing is that there is a restaurant next to the hotel with friendly people i will not go to this hotel again the one most important thing i noticed in los angeles was that everybody was so kind everyone is willing to help everybody is greeting other people so i was very surprised that the staff of this hotel was so rude my other two hotels were awesome with very very kind people so this is probably an exception ,0.05995475,0.053450227,negative,2,1,3,1
comfortable but extremely noisy            i have good news and bad news   first   the good news   the staff at the beverly garland is very friendly and courteous the pool temperature was very comfortable with plenty of towels and lounge chairs the shuttle to universal studios was timely and convenient the beds and pillows were comfortable and the room was clean i especially loved the overstuffed easy chair  extremely comfortable now   the bad news  this was our 2nd stay at the beverly garland holiday inn we must have stay in a different area last time because i don t remember the freeway noise being so loud i kept checking the sliding door  thinking one of the kids might have opened it but no it is just so loud from the constant noise of freeway traffic my husband went to the front desk around 1130pm to request a quieter room the person he spoke to said no 2bed guestrooms were available and said we were in one of the quieter room needless to say we didn t sleep well the rooms are not cheap we paid  csaa rate 144 00  plus sc per night and 9 00 for parking we reserved a 2night stay however we actually checked out of the hotel before the 2nd night  we only stayed one night instead of two  the women who finalized our bill was very nice and she understood us wanting to check out early and allowed us to do so without a penalty for cancelling our reservation i just wanted to go home and get a  good night sleep  i figured driving 6hours home was better than going 8hours with that noise   overall the beverly garland is a decent place the kids loved the pool and the staff is very nice i highly recommend asking for a room far away from the freeway would i stay there again only if i can be guaranteed a room facing furthest away from the freeway ,0.073179275,0.04516807,neutral,1,0,3,3
two nights of noise we spent two nights here while visiting hollywood and warner bros studios at first glance the hotel looks o k   my husband and i both thought it reminded us of the sort of place we stayed in as kids during summer road trips with our families  i e very 1970 s kitsch once inside the rooms are just o k once you hop into bed after a long day of sight seeing   look out it really sounds as if you are sleeping next to the daytona speedway the beds are super shaky  i e if one person moves the entire bed sort of tilts we thought we could mask the freeway noise by keeping the wall unit a c on all night but it s set to a thermostat it starts with a loud bang and stops with a thunk   all night long it s better to just try and deal with the nonstop traffic noise if you bring your own pillows from home make sure that they don t have white pillow cases our pillow cases and one of our pillows vanished the first time housekeeping came to change our linens and haven t been seen since we were promised that they would be mailed to us when they are found on a positive the hotel restaurant was superb the staff was very polite throughout our entire stay that said i don t think we ll be returning anytime soon for an extra 30 00 a night we should have stayed at the sheraton ,0.043539327,0.027621724,negative,1,0,0,2

we liked this hotel we stayed recently  apr 69 and i was so freaked out about arriving to this hotel and finding some awful place but was so relieved to turn the corner and find a nice shady highrise hotel with several buildings  several hotel building pods i guess you might say  we went after most spring breaks were over no crowd in the lobby or at desk we were checked in promptly and our request for a quiet room away from any freeway noise was given no problem we stayed in the portola building 6th floor elevator was easily accessible on both ends of the building the room was large nicely decorated  yes not modern but cozy  the balcony was nice to have with chairs and a table no screens but that wasn t a problem the room was very clean inside and out three pillows to each bed nice easy chair lamp and sidetable by the balcony for sitting and reading nice desk  wonderful lighting clean bathroom small coffee bar area  unfortunately no minifridge  outdoor sink and mirror as well as inside the bathroom so you don t have to wait to do hair makeup nice pool area  heated pool  i was excited to see what i thought was a jacuzzi hot tub but it was a small wading pool they need a hot tub   the shuttle is busy but if it is full he takes them and comes right back for you you don t have to wait another hour frankly we walked home one night it isn t that far if you like to walk this is also just in walking distance to a very nice market complex  ralphs with jamba juice starbucks places to eat etc i think the folks who wrote not nice things are clean freaks people who expected a four star hotel  the hilton is up the hill  this place is just fine everyone was nice i would encourage the hotel to put in minifridges and turn that wading pool into a jacuzzi ,0.061095506,0.028441012,neutral,4,4,0,3
disappointing this was the first of three hotels used on our trip to california and was by far the poorest the rooms were ok but the noise from the freeway was constant and the windows had double glazing which had the noise reducing qualities of tissue paper i would strongly advise the management to replace these as they are useless the lift nearest our room went out of service which meant a trek to the opposite end of the wing i was not impressed and would not recommend to others ,0.036111113,0.08194444,negative,1,0,0,1
definitely not the greatest this place appears great on the surface but if you re a clean freak or just even picky you might not be happy after thinking that our room seemed ok  definitely decorated in the late 70 s  i discovered that the shower had cracks in the tiles and was peeling and it was very difficult to turn the water on for myself and my children also after trying to kill one of the bugs flying around in the room i ended up swatting the lampshade and a huge pile of dust flew off after that experience we looked a little bit harder at the room and even found a gigantic spiderweb up on the ceiling near the curtains totally gross room service pizza was disgusting  about an inch of grease sitting atop the pepperoni  we had to take tons of kleenex and sop it all up before we could even try it and that still didn t help then the 9 pizza turned into over 16 somehow on the final bill the day we wanted to go to universal we got there 15 minutes earlier than they said the first shuttle would run over there and there was already a shuttle full of people on and leaving we were not allowed on and were told to wait the 9 they charge per night for parking is actually 10 after they add the tax plus some entertainment tax of one kind or another my kids liked it  of course  they re kids and not paying  but believe me    you can do better  ,0.055,0.038636364,negative,3,2,1,0

okay i just got back from a week s stay here we ran into no problems if you are used to more upscale hotels i would stay away from here there is no 24 room service and the hotel bar does not open till 5pm it is a great location for visting universal and i also made it down to disneyland in an hour we had a room in the back and it was very quiet the grounds are very nice what you would expect for a southern cal hotel the room was clean bottom line if you are on a tight budget with kids this is a great place if you are used to more higher scale hotels then this is not the place for you ,0.032480314,0.03937008,negative,4,3,0,0

clean comfortable and well priced stayed at the sportsmen s lodge for work for 3 nights the hotel feels somewhat like it has been stuck in 1962 complete with kitschy astroturf ringing the pool the room that i had was on the 3rd floor and faced the pool this only presents a problem if you want to get to sleep early as the pool is frequented until about 11pm room and furnishings appear to have been updated within the last few years and were quite clean and well kept hallways and lobby are beginning to show their age but are quite clean the hotel restaurant was under renovation during my stay so a temporary dining room had been set up in one of the hotel s conference rooms the wait staff still appeared to be ironing out the details of this change as i only had breakfast  cereal and fruit at the hotel i can t comment on the quality of the food though the selection looked decent for all meals staff at reception were quite friendly and happily made taxi reservations to the airport etc overall the hotel is comfortable clean and offers a decent value for la area ,0.04539801,0.027985075,neutral,0,3,4,4
good hotel except for the flies on arrival our room was not ready as we were early however the receptionist was very helpful booking a trip for the next day for us we had asked for a  city view room thinking we would be able to see downtown but we just had a view of a grassy wooded area in which there must have been some stagnant water we opened the patio to have a look round when we first got into the room  noticed the fly screen but didn t pay much attention to it  we ve never used one  unfortunately we left the door open which was enough time for a few flies to join us daft as it may seem i couldn t sleep that night although my husband had got rid of all the flies we could see at the time and he got rid of a couple more when we came in later on  i just felt like there were things crawling on me all night  there weren t   it would have been better if there had been a note on the doors warning you to keep the fly screen closed at all times i was absolutely shattered the next day when we were doing most of our sightseeing other than this the room was spacious and the beds very comfortable a coffee maker was provided plus a fridge and there was a hairdrier and an iron and ironing board there was no safe in the room and when we asked for one of the safety deposit boxes at reception there were none left one of the receptionists said he would let us know if one became available but one didn t we had a problem with the sink not draining when we arrived  would have thought the maid would have spotted that when she cleaned the room prior to our arrival we reported it and someone came to fix it quite quickly the toilet also sometimes needed to be flushed twice but that was not a major problem the room had a connecting door which was a bit disconcerting when the people next door sounded like they were trying to come through the dividing railings between all the balconies are also quite low and there are warnings to keep doors locked at all times there was a fixed head shower in the bathroom and the wardrobe had 10 hangars there was a laundry facilty at the hotel which can be quite useful if you are travelling around a lot the pool area was nice and used by lots of people towels were provided  there was a bar at one end one morning we were going out very early and ordered a room service breakfast eggs  sausage  toast don t bother  it was all at varying stages between lukewarm and cold the next day we went down to the cafe which was better although we waited a while to be served internet access was available just off the lobby by using cash or credit card the location is convenient for road access but there is not a lot nearby if you are wanting to explore on foot we got a taxi up to studio city in the evening but not as much to do there as we had hoped wouldn t stay there again but probably ok if you are driving everywhere and you get a room with a pool view ,0.040534806,0.044567063,negative,3,3,3,4
good place we stayed here for the first two nights of a tour  wished we could have stayed longer rooms were big with balconies very clean the hotel staff were very obliging making me some vegetarian soup after the very cheap sandwich  soup supper my husband  i were sharing contained bits of ham floating in the soup there was a good pool best of all you can buy a 2 day pass to nearby universal studios and have free transport on the hotel shuttle bus ,0.07670455,0.011363637,positive,0,3,4,4
great place to stay i have stayed here two times with my family and we couldn t have been more satisfied with the place i ll admit that it is outdated for the most part although some rooms were renovated a couple of years ago but the rooms remain very clean and spacious the hotel has two restaurants one casual and the other white tablecloth and both offer excellent food at reasonable prices the olympicsize pool is wonderful for serious swimmers and frolickers alike and a cute tiki bar offers every favorite libation the grounds around the hotel could use some sprucing up though some staff members seemed a little indifferent to the needs of guests but most were nice enough the neighborhood is safe and walkable with many restaurants and shops located up and down ventura blvd  including a ralph s grocery store just across the street that is open 24 hours the location itself is very convenient to any other area attractions that beckon tourists i highly recommend staying here if you don t mind a laidback unpretentious atmosphere the rates are reasonable and the parking is free which normally isn t the case in the la area i would definitely stay here again and again ,0.050239235,0.034688994,positive,4,4,4,4

excellent choice my wife and i booked this hotel prior to arriving in la and were pleased that we did the hotel is in a reasonable part of ventura blvd with the usual eateries closeby its a simple 30 minute drive from lax and its close to universal city for the attractions central for the other area s beverly hills hollywood etc  room large enough and clean pool area was airy and has a bar you can purchase breakfast at the restaurant near the pool which is excellent value we had two nights here and would have stayed longer had we not done all of the la sights overall excellent find ,0.06808036,0.035714287,positive,4,4,4,4
good value but not great for business travelers i stayed at the lodge because the rates were good compared to other hotels in the area the room was clean the staff was very friendly the decor is a bit  tired and shabby overall though it was a clean pleasant stay except when it came to getting business done the wireless service was spotty especially in the mornings i wouldn t have minded paying for it if it had worked properly will i stay again not sure great deal for tourists but not necessarily for business folks one additional note i saw some of the other reviews where guests complained about the decor the food etc come on folks what are you expecting for prices like this you want fivestar hotel services book a room at 300 night hotel this is a decent relatively inexpensive place to stay ,0.056587838,0.041385137,neutral,3,2,2,3
very disappointing i stayed here for a second time for 6 nights following a good experience 2 years ago when i stayed for 10 nights in a country where hotel and restaurant staff can never seem to do enough for you the staff at the sportsmens lodge were ignorant unhelpful and generally couldn t care less about my stay or my partners stay whilst the pool scene is very pleasant the rooms are very dated and our bathroom had definitely seen better days i shall never return ,0.056034483,0.050287355,negative,4,3,3,2

overall way too noisy and now they charge for parking we just stayed at the sportsmen s lodge for a big event and upon arrival learned that the new owners now charge 10 a day for parking i find that outragious they also charge 10 for internet although some rooms include it for free   now i don t understand that at all    most hotels include wifi in today s world for free so now it s an extra 20 on top of the room can t use the luggage bell carts anymore  they are locked down and again we were informed that the new management doesn t allow guests to use them  you have to get the bell man  which obviously needs to be tipped then  and dispite the fact that it s a great location great pool and surroundings     the noise was awful several events were going on outside and in the bar area and we wouldn t have gotten any relaxation if we wanted to either inside our room and for sure not outside people walk past the downstairs patio area because it doesn t have a private barrier  so when we sat in our chairs infront of our patio door everybody and the world used the path as a shortcut    very annoying we wished we had a higher floor just so we d have the privacy of the balcony overall i was very disappointed because for the price we could have stayed three nights at a best western    including breakfast free internet and parking ,0.031588446,0.02662455,negative,4,2,1,3
if you want to  feel at home  this is the place to stay this was the third time i stayed at sportsmens and i enjoyed it as much as ever this place is in no way luxurious and as has been pointed out by several reviewers rather old however i still find it really pleasant to stay here because the place has everything that you would need for a comfortable relaxing stay you will find a restaurant that serves traditional american food regular and reliable room service a clean swimming pool fairly large rooms each with an amplesized balcony friendly staff   honestly i cannot really think of what else to ask for i sometimes wish that there were fewer of those entertainment events in early evenings by the pool but even they do not go on and on forever in short it all works here at the sportsmens ,0.050164472,0.039473683,positive,4,2,3,4
ripped off i will never set foot in the building again during my stay a burglar came into our room on the third floor while we were sleeping and stole my briefcase with a little over 5k in cash while we were unable to prove it the most likely thief was an employee of the hotel as entry was gained through the balcony from an adjacent room the hotel denied my insurance claim before i had ever made one i refused to pay my bill but other than that no compensation was ever offered my name is mark rohlfs and i am the owner of santa  sons christmas trees ,0.022727273,0.038636364,negative,1,1,1,1
third time and still enjoyable i ve stayed here twice before many years ago and was worried about suggesting we stay here reading some of the recent reviews it turned out to be a nice experience again the hotel is older and could use some updating but it is a lodge look for a reason the hotel was clean and comfortable and quiet for being on the busy street its on lots of room in the room bed comforatble and hot water in the shower the cafe had good food and was inexpensive considering its in a hotel and in la we didnt use the pool but it looked very inviting and a good place to relax considering some of the recent replies here i guess we just got lucky i wouldnt hesitate to stay here again though ,0.05706522,0.039855074,positive,4,4,4,3
nightmare stay elsewhere coming to l a or planning an event we held a special event here brought in loads of out of town guests and lived to regret it it was a constant series series of problems enough to form a pattern and not just bad luck  from them booking our room out from under us to closing the bar before our prebooked event to overcharging us  after we had checked out add to this a surly staff and mediocre rooms moral of the story  a onetime valley landmark that clearly now only caters to film crews  they were there before we got there and took over the place after we left and is no longer interested in serving tourists or public guests if you had a good stay you got lucky ,0.046328466,0.047649633,negative,1,0,1,1
wanted so much to love it we ve stayed at the sportsmen s lodge three times now and each time we leave we wish we could say we couldn t wait to return it s not a bad place to stay the room was comfortable and clean the food was good and the pool was great we just get the feeling each time that management doesn t care enough to take a hotel with such great potential that extra step particularly in a city as sophisticated as l a  the first thing we noticed when we got there was the smell in the lobby was it mildew or just old carpeting the bathroom off the lobby was even worse the gift shop was another disappointment with dusty old products with unknown brands we would never consider buying we had to ask for new pillowcases because the ones we got were so yellow fortunately our room was very quiet and we got a good night s sleep if you are used to three star hotels you ll probably think it s fine we just expect more from a hotel these days particularly when the room rates are so high ,0.042085428,0.036432162,neutral,3,3,3,4
would give the whole city a miss never mind the hotel la was our last stop before our flight home 3 of us were sharing a quad room after a long slow drive from vegas 3 weary travellers were in need of a decent nights kip the first room we checked into the mattresses were awful and asked to be moved the 2nd room wasn t much better but the mattresses were newer and a bit more agreeable to bad backs so we made do i was searching for alternative accomodation online but gave up because i was so exhausted and we werent going to find anywhere else so late in the day it looked like cars were more likely to be broken into in universal city than the current location after an ok nights sleep decided to stay put as spent more time out and about than in the room room was a bit tired but clean my husband enjoyed the pool very much and made use of the internet and printing facilities as for coming back to the sportsmans lodge i don t think so we didn t think much of the entire city ,0.036989797,0.02997449,negative,0,2,3,4

noisy old hotel my cousine and i spent the nights of december 20 and 21 at the sportsmen lodge we came from boston for the funeral of my cousin brother upon arrival we were very tired and worn out based on the circumstances on checking in we specifically asked at the desk for a quiet room and were assured that would be the case we were given rooms in between  as it turned out a noisy family with children we were disturbed on both nights with crying the kidskicking the adjoining door and loud talking and television we tried to be patient but my cousin finally knocked on their door and asked them to control their children and quiet down it helped some in addition i ordered a side order of toast from room service both mornings the first morning the toast came barely toasted on a plate covered by a paper napkin with no jelly no knife and no napkins i called back to ask for these basic items on friday morning the toast came with jelly but no knife and no napkins ob checkout we complained and were given a 25 discount i followed up with the manager and was offered a free night on our next stay since we will never again be in studio city i found that unacceptable and asked for a night credit after many followup emails and a very long delay the manager offered another 25 discount gain not acceptable hence i have decided to post a review aside from our specific complaints sportsmen lodge is an old and tired motel it looks it and acts it shabby around the edges etc it is one to be avoided ,0.030594405,0.04195804,negative,2,3,2,1

ok so long as you don t need the internet i m staying in the hotel as i write this it s a shame because it has potential to be great but instead it hovers in medicority the beds are ancient using standard hotel bedding which you could find in any travelodge the pool area is nice enough and i particularly like the bar area by the pool but it does get a little old listening to the wedding meetings receptions and so on that can go into very late hours the walls are thin not only could i hear my neighbor but i could hear the woman he was talking to on his cell phone as well but for me the most frustrating thing about the hotel is the internet service i have to pay an additional 10 night to get access to their highspeed wifi service i need this for my work which is mostly email based so it s not like i am watching youtube videos all the time the service is frustratingly slow and prone to breakdowns i have actually had dial up services that were faster i don t understand in this day and age how a hotel can justify charging extra for a very substandard wifi connection not when many hotels will offer excellent connections included in the room rate this is the second time i have stayed here and both times i have visited my connection has gone down unable to get restarted forcing me to change rooms to continue my work even when it is working it is very spotty and slow and i sometimes have to wait agonizingly long times just for my email to be received this isn t my first choice of hotels when in la but sometimes it s my only option as i often have to travel here at the last minute all things considered it s a decent enough place but with just a little more attention to detail it could be great and they could have me as a regular customer instead i head elsewheres    ,0.034285713,0.040357143,negative,0,3,2,2
