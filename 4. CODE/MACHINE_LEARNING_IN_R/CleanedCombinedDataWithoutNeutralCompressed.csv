way out in boston best western terrace inn 1650 commonwealth avenue boston ma usastayed sep 2008 one night double room location actually on mount hood road off commonwealth avenue between washington street and sutherland street boston mbta green line b tram stops the tram journey is roughly 4050 mins from park street and government centre downtown stations so the hotel is not very handy for doing things in the centre of the city there are few facilities near the hotel  the hotel staff said one thai one italian restaurant a 711 shop and a pharmacycumus mail officewe found them very near  the hotel is more of a motel with three separate blocks reception and two separate bedroom blocks which have no covered ways between them so if it is raining there are steps to reception but there is access by ramp via dining area for wheelchairs bedroom block 1xx  ground 2xx has no lift to upper floor did not assess block with rooms 3xx5xx being just off commonwealth avenue saves it from traffic noise so it is quieter than one may anticipate the room we had was plain but very spacious and cleano criticism of that the welcome was pleasant and helpful but the ontinental breakfastwas at the poorer end of the scale cereals yoghourt fresh fruit bread and rolls  bagels but no meats or cheeses the fruit juices were really diluted fruit rinksrather than fresh or 100 reconstituted the rockeryis of the plasticised paper variety plus plastic lassesand polystyrenefoam tea coffee containers  ups similarly the cutlery is plastic with no large spoon the hotel was willing to extend checkout time by one hour  to noon and to safekeep luggage after checkout until later in the day is this the boston location or quality you want for 171  192 incl taxes ,negative,2,2,2,4
wow we found this hotel on priceline and we were looking for a fenway weekend the hotel was obvious because it really is in the back of a gas station parking lot checkin at the front desk was super easy and the front desk clerk was so friendly helpful and polite checkin literally took less than 30 seconds including when he asked if we wanted 1st or 2nd floor the rooms are set up like they might be in warmer climates  instead of everything in one building there were several groups of 2story buildings with maybe 10 or so rooms in each group there s parking on site  and it s free  a total luxury in boston and the whole time i felt safe even parking my new car out there the room was nothing special  not huge or anything but it was absolutely spotless fridge microwave desk wireless internet all right there even the bathroom didn t have one speck of mold or dirt it s even environmentally friendly with those signs you can leave out if you can handle using the towels and sheets more than once we got directions to both walk to fenway  it s about 1 5 miles or take the train  t is about a 4 minute walk and how to get back after a night of baseball and drinking  i would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone who asked it s in a quiet neighborhood only a short distance to the t and the price wasn t bad at all for boston area a  ,positive,3,0,5,5
comfy and clean stayed with wife and 2 teenage kids for 5 nights paid about 175 night half a block from the washington st t stop green line free parking wireless pretty good breakfast very good service fritz ran the front desk and he was great rooms aren t very big but very clean location is very good and you can save a few bucks by using the t no pool they don t change towels or sheets unless you ask knowledgable staff and helpful recommended especially given the prices in boston it s no great bargin but affordable some very good places to eat close by ,positive,4,0,4,4
awful we found this hotel through a college website it was listed as a hotel in the vicinity of boston college and close to downtown boston we were planning a trip to see the some of the colleges in boston and didn t want to spend a fortune   so we booked it big mistake i knew we were in trouble when we saw it was practically in the parking lot of a gas station   it s just behind the gulf station the check in was fine people were friendly and helpful but when i saw the room i nearly cried it looked dirty the room was dingy and old   really fairly run down the bathroom had a frosted window   no curtain   that looked out on the parking lot if you opened the bathroom window   anyone outside had a full view in we all felt so uncomfortable that we cut our stay down from 2 nights to 1 we just couldn t sleep there it s location is closest to boston college but it was a bit of a trip to boston u and northeastern u what the best western considers a shuttle service is actually the boston subway system this hotel is located on the very outskirts of boston it is in a rather seedy area and we really didn t feel safe waiting for the subway or walking back to the hotel at night it took about 35  45 minutes by subway to get into downtown boston it was not a pleasant ride we loved boston itself  it is a great place to visit my advice is to spend a bit more for a clean bed bathroom and get closer to downtown ,negative,1,0,1,1
careful its cheap but shabby nice staff but the place is well past its best when we checked in our initial impression of the room was not good the a c was not really working and the fridge in the kitchenette would not close properly the room was clean but needs updating my wife could not sleep as we were in a double room and it was too hot with non functioning a c the positives nice areahelpful staffnegativespoor parking not enough rooms are shabbywill not be going back ,negative,2,0,2,3
good value in boston we stayed here for one night it is easy to get to the heart of boston on the subway the rooms are spacious and the free breakfast is good we got there early and they let us check in early the area seems safe we would stay there again for sure we covered the stay using over airmiles which was an extra score ,positive,4,4,4,4
awful we booked this hotel because the boston college website listed it as a local place to stay we planned on staying two nights and we had booked two rooms at a rate of 169 00 per night when we arrived my husband commented that it looked like the bates motel once inside our room  we were horrified the room had been decorated in the 70 s and had never been updated it was extremely shabby and the bedspreads and carpet were stained worst of all was the disgusting smell of smoke and stale air it was so bad that we told the front desk clerk that we didn t want to stay there  the clerk informed us that he may have to charge us anyway we told him fine knowing that we would stop our credit card payment and make a formal complaint against the hotel our trip to the boston area ended up lovely we checked into the doubleday suites and were very happy there the rate at this hotel was actually less expensive because a two room suite was 199 00 and accommodated our family just fine the bottom line is don t stay at the best western inn in boston there are so many other options of great places to stay ,negative,1,0,2,1
ok but some cons i stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in october the hotel was very clean seemed to be in a very safe neighborhood and provided an adequate breakfast it was a one block walk from the green line  b branch washington st  however the hotel is rather far from downtown the trolley ride is very very slow and tedious and i found the green b line trains to be the most infrequent as such it usually took us at least 30 minutes to get to downtown in addition on the second night we were kept awake by a loud party from about 2am3am i called the front desk but found them to be extremely unhelpful and completely unconcerned the hotel was the best value that i could find that was still in a decent neighborhood again it was clean and there were no problems with the room itself however due to its inconvenient location and unhelpful staff i will not stay there again ,negative,3,0,2,1
great area not great hotel i ended up getting this hotel through priceline there was a conference in town and i had a hard time finding anything else even through regular reservations overall i was very disappointed to start off my first room had a shower that the wall had been busted out and mold wasv everywhere there was also no kitchen and the hotel lists that every room has a kitchen  it must be saved for priceline customers  i was moved promptly to a room a bit larger with a kitchen and at least it was in tact pros staff was nice unexperienced but nice location was quiet residential and right next to the tcons very dirty the bathroom was infested with house centipedes   i saw a family of them  bathtub did not drain  took about an hour after the shower was finished i asked everyday for it to be fixed but it never was  large groups stay here while the neighborhood is quiet the group can have lots of parties  nonsmoking room smelled of thick smoke i did report my unhappiness to the corporate office and they said i would be contacted by management no one ever contacted me this hotel has potential because of the location but need a complete overhaul ,negative,4,1,1,3
not what we expected we booked this hotel because it was very close to boston university where we were dropping our daughter off for graduate school the area was fine     we were able to walk to a grab a bite to eat in the surrounding area without difficulty the free parking was a definite plus our main gripe was with the room which was very very damp it was a warm night but the whole room and even the bed linens felt very humid and damp also the free breakfast was only marginal too many people scurrying for a table and towards the end of the designated hours they stopped putting out more food so all you could have was what was picked over by others we ll be looking for another place to stay when we go back to visit boston ,negative,4,2,1,1
not the best best western we stayed here with my 14 month old daughter for a week in june of 2006 the room was supposed to be a nonsmoking room but certainly didn t smell that way the area seemed ok  however we did hear what sounded like 8 gunshots at about 3am which didn t exactly make us feel secure the room was basically clean but hadn t been refurbished in what seemed like years and so didn t feel really clean the first portable crib they sent was broken the staff wasn t too bad but not as responsive as i wanted it took them a day to fix the ac heat in our room not the worst i stayed in by any means but definitely not the best it wasn t up to the standard i expect out of best western i probably wouldn t stay here again ,negative,2,0,2,2
great tourist value we booked the best western terrace inn as a 99 per night special from a go boston card i ordered online through their tourism dept i called a few days in advance to reserve it really was only 99 per night it was right on the green line although almost at the outside edge near boston univ west but in 25 min  you were downtown no driving free parking okay rooms free expanded continental breakfast  waffles cereal fruit etc a wonderful spanish restaurant was around the corner friendly staff for the price we were able to stay an extra day the marriot at the embarcadero charges 40 per day just to park ,positive,4,5,5,4
great for a short trip or game this is a nice clean small hotel the rooms were clean and included a mini kitchen ie stove top fridge and mini microwave and sink some dishes and cook wear is susplied the shower is cramped but clean the beds say queen but seem like a double and you kind of roll to the middle but on the day of our check out all new beds were being installed so that might help all the staff were excellant very helpful we arrived and were checked in instantly good safe free parking and close to the t maybe a block walk but your in boston so you exspect to walk we went for a game and it was clean quick and close one note our room was on the ground floor level and i m a light sleeper i could hear the upstairs room walking around all night    130am 330 am the next morning i proptly asked if the hotel was booked soild and if i could be switched  not a problem at all   they could of said no but i feel like the gentleman went out of his way to rebook me the staff makes this hotel a perk i will deffiantly return for a game visit ,positive,4,0,0,4
pleasantly surprised i was pleasantly surprised at the great service location and price of this hotel with downtown boston hotel prices being near 300 per night this hotel offers a refreshing discount the hotel is next to the subway and the continental breakfast was just right why pay the high prices of downtown when this hotel is literally minutes away from it all ,positive,4,4,4,4
never again don t even think about it don t go there don t stay there avoid it like the plaguebest western should be ashamed ,negative,0,0,0,0
2 rooms out of 3    not bad the terrace inn is very convenient is well maintained has a reasonable breakfast and is reasonably priced for boston i would have liked to rate this hotel 5 stars but an annoying thing happened when i stayed there recently i made reservations for 3 rooms at this hotel 5 months prior to the date because it was boston university graduation weekend  my wife and i and 2 other relatives were coming up  i called several times over the 5 months to make sure we stil had our 3 rooms each time we were reasured the reservation was there for 3 rooms we got a letter from them stating since it was a busy weekend our deposit was non refundable if we canceled within a few weeks of the date not nice but we accepted that since we were coming for sure we arrived on the day came in at 130 pm they told us they had our 3 rooms reserved but they were not ready yet no problem we would leave our luggage there see the sights of wonderful boston and return after dinner just to be safe i called at 330 pm to see if we needed to do anything else for our 3 room reservation no they said everything was taken care of we had our 3 rooms we returned at 930 pm to be told we had  2 rooms not 3 we overbooked and since you had 3 rooms we thought you could get by with 2 they said nicely  i have no complaints about the weekend night manager he was stuck with the situation he didnt create  all of boston was booked it was late they gave us 20 off each room and gave us two rooms a suite with two rooms the relatives had to share and a room with two single beds for me and my wife the next morning i requested and got an additional room upon checking out i asked the manager how this happened and he said we don t do this on purpose it just sometimes happens that was it you other travellers can tell me if this happens frequently to you  has never happened to me in 49 years i emailed the best western office they said i would hear within a week  haven t heard anything in 1 1 2 weeks from the terrace inn we got by ok for one night it wasn t that big of a deal but my questions are if you can take all my money if i don t show up why can t you make sure everyone who puts that money up has a room have you looked into this mistake to see how often it happens wouldn t it be nice to respond to questions referred from the main officeso i suggest they study the overbook policy or drop that no refund policy on busy weekends if you make reservations you might want to have a cancelable reservation somewhere else just in case ,negative,3,3,3,2
totally gross and cheesy let me first admit that i m giving this an ok rating due to the fact that my wifi worked and had a great connection now when i walked into my room it just looked awful super cheap comforter awful appliances really dusty and gross closets and that unsure feeling of should i really walk on the carpet and to make sure i wasn t thinking this myself my coworker who i traveled with had all of this plus a horrid smelling room ok so it is clsoe to the t train but it is very hard to find while driving and it isn t really worth finding all in all this hotel is fine of the rooms are going for 39 99 a night but for 125 you could at least get the musly smell out of the room   first time here and the last time for sure ,negative,0,0,2,1
notsogreat stay we stayed at the terrace inn in the summer of 04 the hotel is in an awkward location and difficult to get to by car if you are not familiar with the streets when we asked for new sheets  ours were stained we had to walk out to the lobby to retrieve it ourselves when we had questions about internet access the person working at the front desk was completely clueless and could not help us  it turns out they only had dialup even though the lamp in the room had a dataport we found spiderwebs in the corner of the rooms as well one morning we had our privacy please sign up on our door yet the cleaning lady knocked on the door and said that there were people here to replace our curtains this was very unexpected and rude especially since there was a reason for placing that sign on the door complimentary breakfast is served but guests should arrive early or take the food to their rooms the breakfast room is too small to accomodate everyone ,negative,2,1,0,1
great area in boston we had to take our son to boston children s hospital and this hotel is extremely close by the amenities of this hotel are great and accomodating especially after a long day in the hospital the bar area was great the food court attached had everything for somebodies taste and the hotel was close to the train fenway park and tons of other neat attractions at one point during our visit the hotel had to shut down the water not their fault however an inconvenience and our a c did not work the greatest however the rooms were clean and comfortable ,positive,5,0,0,3
decent place  would recommend this best western is nicer and cleaner than most best westerns initially we had some trouble finding the lobby to check in but only because we went in through the food court cvs entrance at the front desk check in was hassle free but the desk staff wasn t friendly at all he mumbled something about our room having been given away so we had gotten a free upgrade to an apartment suite we were a little confused but hey it was a free upgrade the apartments are in a separate part of the building from the hotel and aren t bad really the hallway once you exit the elevator is a little small and cheap looking and there was a bag of linens  clean or dirty i m not sure sitting in the hallway for the entire duration of our stay  granted we did only stay one night  but once you enter the apartment it is cozy and simply decorated and the kitchen is even outfitted with dishes and paper towels etc there were a few things i noticed which might bother some people but didn t really bother me one is that there were some noticeable holes in one of the walls which just need a little spackle another is that there was a teeny bit of mold mildew in between the shower tiles and the shower curtain could have been a little cleaner other than those small things the apartment was nice and clean enough the hotel itself is only a 6 block walk from fenway and in the same building as a food court cvs also the longwood restaurant on premises is actually pretty good and not expensive i would stay here again if i needed to be in the vicinity of fenway or the hospitals ,negative,3,4,3,3
no problems here gotta say that i read these reviews after i made our reservation and i was a little concerned however i found the negative comments totally unfounded our room was clean and comfortable the staff was friendly and very helpful the parking was hassle free and very reasonable for overnight city parking and it was an easy 15 minute walk to fenway the only down side that i could see is there is no nightlife in the immediate area the onsite restaurant and bar are both good and the adjacent food court provide a quick and cheap meal option ,positive,0,3,3,4
giives new meaning to the word  filthy my husband and i stayed at the inn at longwood medical because of it s proximity to dana farber cancer center and brighams and woman s hospital i was somewhat hesitant because of the reviews here but it is the closest hotel to the medical facilities so we booked i was completely unprepared to the actual filth and dirt in the room i wiped down the remote the light switch one doorknob and the heating air conditioning dial and the antibacterial wipe i was using was dark gray and black astounding then we pulled down the sheets and found long black hair between the sheets i lifted up the sheets to check the mattress pad because of an earlier review i read involving bedbugs and was so dismayed to see dirt and very short very curly hair embedded in the mattress pad overall the state of the room was disgusting staff was fine checkin out was fine complimentary breakfast was fine i just wish there was another hotel close by to have another option for overnight stays ,negative,4,3,2,1
good bad and the ugly we chose this hotel based on the photo and description on the hotel s own website it was a bit misleading the hotel is difficult to find considering that it sits in top the galleria  not a mall despite the name among several medical facilities and colleges we passed it and had to turn around  a complicated proposition considering the volume of foot traffic in the area the traffic signals are slow and pedestrians  mostly medical school students in a hurry pretty much ignore them creating a major driving hassle we parked in the garage adjacent to the hotel which costs 18 day the spaces are small and some valet service also uses the garage  double parking all over the place creating another headache front desk staff was minimal and we ended up waiting for our parking voucher every time we came and went that s the bad the good the room had a great layout and was spacious it included a table desk microwave fridge sink  basically a small kitchenette  and a whole wall of windows  the windows faced apartment windows which was a bit disconcerting  imagine looking out and seeing a man changing his clothes in his bedroom not 50 feet away  the location was great for walking  much to see and plenty of restaurants to choose from as a matter of fact the galleria food court is literally an elevator ride away there we could choose from a variety of quick meals  mexican chinese american subs sushi soup coffee smoothies even dairy queen and mcdonalds the ugly unfortunately there was an ugly the toilet was unstable and filled inconsistently the shower never stopped dripping and had a slow  extremely slow drain my ten minute shower practically turned into a bath the bathroom sink had a problem with uneven water pressure the lighting in the room was inadequate  four lamps with dim bulbs did not provide enough light and opening the curtains was not much help since the hotel is in the shadows of tall hospital buildings the door was challenging to close and latch and i found the single chain lock  no deadbolt to be insufficient on an odd note the hotel has framed photography on display and for sale in the lobby yet when we inquired about purchasing a piece  which was a fundraiser for the adjacent hospital by the way  no one knew how to sell it to us we left without the piece why display prices and post information about the fundraiser and then be unable to sell the pieces disappointing if i had someone in one of the nearby hospitals this would be my hotel of choice but otherwise i won t be back ,negative,1,1,1,1
what a beautiful room i stayed at this hotel on friday night in june the room was beautiful  spacious  large king bed with a kitchenette  a treat in a downtown hotel since frequently rooms in downtown feel like my closet the kitchenette was also lovely we had room service for breakfast and in the evening the breakfast came exactly at the requested time  hot  cooked perfectly and the evening was equally responsive the front desk staff was equally attentive helpful and efficient we were in town for a concert so the concierge was very helpful in getting us a taxi and ensuring that the driver knew exactly where we going and to get us there promptly great job it was in a good location to go to the bu harvard medical fenway northeastern u  and the hospital district we were going to the bu area ,positive,5,4,4,4
not a great place not a great hotel quality of staff was uneven often unfriendly room maintenance was poor the door did not close properly shower poor quality room somewhat cramped ,negative,1,0,1,1
beware  bed bugs we were in boston due to a medical emergency we had a very young baby with us so we wanted to be as close to the hospital as possible because we were there for 10 days we had to stay in many different rooms the rooms were mediocre and the price i thought was high even with medical discount we found a couple of the staff great  very helpful went over and above and others totally rude but our biggest problem was bed bugs i was bitten over 100 times on my face  gross   chest arms and hands my adult daughter received fewer bites that became very and infected luckily the baby did not show any bites we are still trying to resolve this situation with the management who has not been overly helpful if you absolutely have to stay here for closeness to the hospitals i would thoroughly check the room for bed bugs make sure you take a flashlight we actually saw two bugs in bathroom but thought they were ticks being from a rural mountainous area this made sense to us until we saw all the bites it is an extremely traumatic event to know that bugs have been feeding all over you in the night both my daughter and myself are suffering from post traumatic stress because of it we are always looking for bugs now and jumping out of bed to check i should say that we had stayed at this hotel before several years ago and had loved it hopefully another hotel chain will build a hotel in this area soon so that people experiencing a medical crisis have a choice be very xareful about your luggage  we are still not sure if we brought any home with us or not ,negative,0,1,1,1
best western again spent three nights here while calling on clients the staff was very helpful with directions around the city as well as outside of the city room was clean but a little noisey they were doing work on the floor i was on internet was free and a consistent signal i liked the restaurant and bar  had room service also very good ,positive,0,3,4,4
marginal hotel poor value the only thing good about this hotel is its location if you have a loved one at one of the hospitals as it is an easy walk to several major hospitals we stayed the night before surgery for my partner at brigham  women s hospital and was booked for four nights i checked out after just one night the room was tiny and cramped desperately needed upgrading as it was worn and tired i ve seen dorm rooms from the 1960 s that were better i couldn t get the internet connection to work we had to take the top off the toilet to make it stop running after every flush and the cleaning was superficial including the discovery of a soggy moldy coffee packet in the coffeemaker how dare this hotel charge 189 regular rate and 159 special medical rate for this room parking is an extra cost as well i got a much cleaner nicer room at the boston park plaza for 119 per night and rode the green line train for the remainder of my stay other than a room this hotel offers nothing one might seek for amenities it is dreary it is adjacent to the longwood galleria which has a decent restaurant but is otherwise a small food court like you see in a mall unless you absolutely want to or need to be at the hospitals avoid this hotel ,negative,4,2,2,2
ripping off the medical community and its patients  stay away please note before reading this review that i have stayed at this hotel at least four times in the past year but this last time was for sure the last the front desk staff including the hotel manager is rude they don t give correct information at times and they don t communicate information when changing shifts the night we arrived the hotel s entire computer system crashed we were told not asked to wait in the lobby for over an hour with a 14mo old the hotel manager offered that they have no emergency plan for this type of problem since it never happened before   after an hour we approached the desk and were told that the computer was up but they still couldn t make key cards we waited again for the engineer to come and let us into the room for 5 mins  he tried to open our room using a long wire that he put under the door to hook the door handle on the other side yikes the rug was terribly filthy since after 30 mins of crawling around my son s clean outfit was black not brown from the filth there was an industrial fan on the floor in the hallway outside our room it seems as though there had been a flood in our room since the ceiling was cracked and poorly repaired in the corner perhaps this explains the filthy carpet and hallway fan on a prior visit the heater didn t work the engineer came to fix it and there was a disgusting old baby bottle in there along with actual piles of dust that came out the last time we were at this hotel we vowed never to come again but since children s was paying for the stay we didn t want to look a gift horse in the mouth we now feel that we d rather drive to the hospital from a decent hotel across town than stay at a onestar motel like this again the hotel has a prime location no doubt with many of the hospitals right there i feel they are ripping off the medical community and its patients since they are the only hotel in this area it doesn t seem as though they are putting any money back into the hotel for upkeep modernization or cleaning ,negative,5,0,1,1
totaly awful myself and a friend specifically booked a room with 2 beds when we arrived we were informed that none were available and that they had put us into a room with a single queen sized bed this considering we were two male friends travelling was certainly not acceptable the only option was to pay for a foldout cot to be wheeled into the room the hotel is also connected to a hospital so be prepared for sick people wandering the corridors and constant ambulance sirens outside your bedroom window during the night our room was also never cleaned with dirty mugs and glasses being left unwashed for the entire stay at the end of our stay we noticed a sign which read if we can help with another stay at a best western please ask it happened we were travelling down to new york so asked if they could find out availability in nyc at a best western the concierge told us that he wasn t going to help us and to look up the number in a phone book and do it ourselves from the phone is our room we were then billed for the calls all in all it been one of the worst hotel experiences i have had and would heartily discourage anyone who is considering staying at this hotel ,negative,1,0,1,1
awesome stay we just returned from a four night stay at the inn we really enjoyed the large room and the way housekeeping kept it looking wonderful during our stay after a long day of sightseeing we knew that we would be coming back to a clean and well locked room we were delighted that it was close to the t and tat there were places to eat right there the room service was great too there were no problems with checking in or out and the staff was incredably nice it is defintaly somewhere we would stay again ,positive,4,4,4,5
this hotel has only one thing going for it  location this hotel has unattractive small dark standard rooms the windows do not open and the antiquated noisy climate control system can not be regulated well expect blasts of cold air or heat all night long depending on the season no toiletries are provided other than soap and shampoo service was indifferent with the exception of one hospitable cleaning person the reservation for one of our two rooms was lost because our name was spelled incorrectly the reservation confirmations do not have a reference number on them unless you request one fortunately i did so and was able to help retrieve the lost reservation by providing the number three requests to speak with the manager received promises of return calls but no action absolutely no reason to stay here other than its proximity to several major hospitals ,negative,4,0,1,1
dark and dirty but conveniently located i m quite surprised that travellers rate this hotel as highly as they do i spend 30 to 60 days each year in hotel rooms travelling for business i typically stay in hampton inns holiday inns and courtyard by marriott i have stayed at the inn at longwood several times during the past two years when my son has been admitted to children s hospital for treatment this hotel is quite worn dark and not particularly clean the staff is adequate at best my stays at this hotel rank at the bottom of my list of hotel experiences if this hotel was not situated in the center of the medical hospital district there truly would be no reason to stay here ,negative,4,0,2,2
mediocre but convenient the hotel is old and in need of a face lift parking is located in a public lot adjacent to the hotel so hotel checkin access and unloading from the garage is awkward parking is 18 per day which is cheap compared to other hotels in the copley square area the double room size is small especially the bathroom and they are stingy with the linens one towel per guest one small pillow etc the service at the front desk is slow but friendly location is definitely convenient to attractions in that part of the city but don t expect a luxury hotel food at the grille is just okay and you have to walk a bit for better food selection ,negative,2,3,4,1
beware  this place is terrible we arrived to find that we had no room after much discussion we were found a room   which had no hot water and the water pressure did not exist this was the high point as we needed wading boots to get to our bed the air conditioner had a leak which soaked the carpet the ac had not been turned on so we had the pleasure of staying in a stinky moldy room hotels com was of no use our stay was hoffific ,negative,1,0,1,1
won t ever come back first the positives   we arrived at 1045 a m  and they had a room for us shortly the people at the desk were friendly and helpful now the negatives   after inching our way through terrible boston traffic the parking garage was full so we parked a couple of blocks away and walked through the rain to the hotel the room at 169 night is small and tatty the bathroom is a kneebanger there is a deionizer heater running in the room possibly to remove smoke odor there is broadband internet connection but if you re on the fifth floor as we were expect a very weak wifi signal supposedly you can hardconnect but the receptacles in the room are the old style telephone connectors  no ethernet receptacles and the hotel doesn t furnish cables like many don t count the nearby galleria food court as a plus it s a cattle stampede at noon lest you think we re just overlycritical we stayed at two wonderful chain motels on the way to this one and reviewed them both positively parking by the way is 18 day free at most motels bottom line if you re a patient at one of the many area hospitals perhaps you don t care about any of this but if you re in boston on business or pleasure take a pass find a chain motel outside the inner city where the expense is less and there are more amenities ,negative,2,0,1,4
first best western stayed here when to visit someone in the hospital it was recommended by the hospital my stay was a good one in an otherwise bad situation the food and drinks were good in the restaurant  the staff very helpful and friendly in an awkward time for me my room was comfortable and clean and the free wirless was good to keep me connected with work had a little free time and was able to see a little boson by using the train and walking overall the stay was good and staff made me fell at ease ,positive,4,4,4,4
great place to stay my experience with this hotel was outstanding their customer service was of the highest quality i dealt directly with the manager bill davies he is truly an asset to this hotel and a person of the highest caliber i can t wait to have an opportunity to deal with him the hotel again in the future ,positive,4,0,0,5

ok hotel good location my wife and i stayed in this hotel for a week while her mother was undergoing surgery in the hospital which was right next door good location the hotel itself was in pretty bad shape the rooms were very small and the elevators were broken the heat was broken during my visit and the lobby was over 100 degrees other than that the staff there were friendly and helpful we ve stayed at 5 star hotels all over the country and we ve never met anyone as spirited and professional as denise at the front desk she is very helpful and made our stay very accommodating it was an absolute pleasure to chat with her everyday if you ever stay at the best western ask denise about all the amazing places to visit in boston although this hotel is mediocre at best our experiences here were phenomenal this hotel would have gotten a 5 star review  ,positive,4,0,3,4
service was not good but convenient location for the hospitals my parents stayed there for 13 days since they needed to visit one of the hospitals in longwood area i visited them several times the room was tiny and the bath room was not cleaned most of the time many stuff members were not very helpful i thought the price was too high however the location is perfect for the hospitals in a cold icy snowy day you want to visit hospitals without worrying about the weather ,negative,4,0,1,2

not the best and not a boutique hotel stayed at the capitol hotel as my last stop in australia loved sydney but not this hotel it is a basic three star and the fact that it is owned by rydges is quite surprising definetly not a boutique hotel unless this is the ambition certainly the work and transformation had not started during my stay in july first impression was not good the reception area has a sterile youth hostel feel about it the girl on reception was okay but no aussie welcome during my stay i would say some staff here where polite and friendly while others had little motivation in their job stayed in room 514 which was compact and comfortbale but nothing special bathroom very small and quite tacky location wise no complaints caught the train from the airport to central station which is about a 10  15 minute journey then its just a short walk to the hotel capitol square is right next to the theatre of the same name with a small shopping centre starbucks and irish pub in the same block directly next to china town some of which isn t that picturesque but darling harbour which is brilliant is only a 15 minute walk away circular quay is easy to reach either by taking the train or a ferry from darling harbour which is certainly the most fun way or a good walk down george street never had breakfast in the hotel instead whent along to darling harbour and had great meals sitting in the sunshine in one of the numerous outdoor cafes ,positive,4,0,3,4
noisy i requested a quiet room when booking i was given a room where you could distinctly hear people in the adjacent rooms coughing or talking which make me wake up at nightime the room was tiny but this would have been fine for the price i paid if a better sound insulation had been provided this is not what you expect from a hotel of this category no information at all was provided about telephone and internet rates in the room i came back one night and found the entrance shut with a sign saying reception is temporarily closed and i had to wait outside for a while before being allowed to get into my room ,negative,0,0,2,1
compact stayed here for three nights when passing through sydney on business and a tightish budget got a good price through the visitors centre most things about this hotel were just ok the room i had could be described as  compact but no worse than in most major cities room was clean bathroom pretty small  especially the bath  why bother a shower would do in the space available  breakfast adequate i was on the second floor and was alarmed at the noise coming up from the restaurants next door when i exited the lift i suspect the walls are pretty thin between rooms too although luckily i didn t have noisy neighbours and the restaurant noise didn t actually stop me sleeping i recommend the bangkok restaurant next door incidentally  i think i was probably the only nonthai person there which is a pretty good indication of its quality two things annoyed me a lot firstly the high internet charges 50c a minute and i think your usage was capped at an hour in every 24 hours though i didn t carry on using it too long at that price there s also secondly the booklet in the room recommends guests make use of the safety deposit boxes at reception  well they re tiny far too small to get any valuable objects into unless they re paper and can be folded ,negative,0,3,2,2
move out booked this hotel on rydges web site billy elliot at the capital hotel next door the room was very small with 2 single bedsbathroom room for one person only at a time window faced on to a alley  dark room very tired hotel expected more from the rydges group if you want to go to see a show at the capital  try the metro opposite ,negative,0,0,0,3
great location pity about everything else i have stayed in many different sydney hotels and this time around i searched for a well located hotel within sydney for a reasonable rate for a one night stay just before christmas with a rate of 99 for a sunday night stay in sydney capitol square hotel appeared to fit the bill for this so i was happy to book through the rydges com website upon my arrival at the hotel late on the sunday evening the reception was attended by two staff members one of whom was on the phone the other simply looked up at me blankly and said check in with what name i mean come on it takes only a few seconds more to actually say hello and actually get to know your guest so i was rightly annoyed at this lack of courtesy the same staff member then thrust a registration card at me and simply said can i have your credit card so i can take an imprint why bother employing staff when they do not actually bother to get to know their guestsi was allocated a room on the 5th floor of the hotel and told by the staff member that this was the good floor to be on well if this was the good floor i would really hate to see the other ones the room had splotchy marks all over the carpets dented old furniture and to make things even worse the bathroom was literally the size of a closet and did not have any towels at all so i had to call back downstairs to reception to ask for some towels to be sent up to my room i called twice and on both occasions the number simply rang out on the third attempt my request was finally answered by a staff member who treated my call with contempt and merely stated that they would bring them up when they got a moment i mean i am a paying guest surely my concerns are a priority checking out early on monday morning was certainly very fast i arrived at the reception desk and said that i was checking out the staff member merely said back to me what room and then proceeded to check me out without even a moments pause my request to speak to someone about my stay merely yielded a response of the manager will not be here until 9am and i can t help you i have stayed at many different hotels in sydney and elsewhere and this is the first time that i have actually been told that my opinion is worthless this hotel has a great location at the heart of the entertainment district with darling harbour nearby however the service here is simply appalling and definately not up to the standards of a rydges property throughout my stay i gained the impression that i was simply not important enough to be listened to and that the staff simply do not care as long as you pay up and get out in time next time i am in sydney and paying for my own accommodation i will definately be staying at ibis world square or metro on pitt who i am sure will actually appreciate and enjoy having me as a guest ,negative,4,0,3,1
unprofessional and disorganised my friend and i were only in sydney for one night to go to a concert so we were happy to stay in a budget hotel in a busy area the place wasn too noisy and the location is fantastic a short 5 minute walk to central station and heaps of shops restaurants etc the bathroom and room were clean apart from the doona cover which had urine stains and the carpet which had a large orange stain  not that the carpet matters  however it was the poor service we received when we arrived that turned us off i was called the day before the booking and informed that there was an error with wotif com the website kept taking bookings even though they were full so they were now overbooked the lady was very nice and explained that they arranged accommodation for us across the road at the metro which has the same starrating and amenities and would be the same price for the inconvenience capitol would throw in a complimentary breakfast too we arrived at the metro and waited in line a while and when we got to the desk the staff couldn find our booking about ten minutes was spent waiting in line and then waiting for the staff to go through the system to find us checking with other staff etc then we were told they needed to call the capitol because they couldn find our booking i wasn too happy about all the waiting as we had a tight turnaround time before we had to leave for our concert and we were hoping to get a nanna nap in before we left we waited another ten minutes while the metro staff tried for a while to get through to the captitol  either the phone was busy or noone was answering but we were finally told that the capitol did have a room for us now that inconvenience waiting in line when youe tired hungry and thirsty for no reason whatsoever we got to capitol and waited in line some more we overheard the clerk say to the customers in front of us as they left for their room that they were in the oodside of the hotel meaning away from the street and the roadworks how unprofessional to say that at all admitting that there a good and bad side to a hotel when you pay the same rate and worse in front of other customers we were given our room key and i asked if breakfast was still included in my opinion we been stuffed around more waiting across the road unnecessarily than we would have been if we actually checked in to the metro the clerk checked our paperwork and said that our booking didn include it i explained that we been told we were now getting complimentary breakfast to which the manager told the clerk right in front of us  we weren important enough to be acknowledged that no our booking didn come with breakfast and we weren supposed to go to the metro at all  as if it was our fault we went there  we were told to go to the metro by capitol but they wouldn admit their mistake nor make good on their conciliation for the hassle annoyed i pointed out that they wasted our time about half an hour  meaning no nap  indirectly the clerk then accused us of lying by checking his watch and saying it only been ten minutes since he received the phone call from the metro again they didn seem to grasp the fact that it was their fault we were waiting 20 minutes at the metro not the metros or ours the capitol handling of the issue made us feel completely undervalued a free breakfast is nothing compared to the loss of repeat business from people who stay in sydney cbd regularly so there you have it location good amenities okay service appalling ,negative,4,0,3,1
hostel type accomodation my parents and i stayed in the family room for 4 nights in june 07 upon arrival we were asked to deposit 50 for 10 days which we weren t aware of  we booked throu expedia com au and no such info was available  the room was small which we didnt mind the floor boards throughout the room made noise everytime you walked the bed cover was faded ad had many stains and a few holes the beds are certainly not comfortable one major issue we had was the air conditioning unit in the room was blowing cold air in the middle of the night breakfast is quite simple and not worth 10 one thing that we were quite annoyed about was the fact that the hotel is dirty by anyone s standard the towels are well used and in need of replacement in my opinion the hotel is not a 3 star hotel the hotel has vending machines for alcohol bevereges snacks toothbrushes etc   so you cannot really say that this is a hotel it had a hostel feel to it i was aware that the hotel went through a soft refurbishing but i think soft refurbishing meant that they changed the carpet only location is not very good it takes over 10 mins to walk to central station or the town hall station the hotel is not too far to darling harbour which seems to be the only positive side of the hotel being on a main street it is very noisy at nights there is a bar pub downstairs which adds to the street noise there are also restaurants on the other side of the hotel and you can definitely hear the noise when you are n the hallways i suggest to shop around for a hotel in sydney this hotel is too expensive for 95115 a night for 2 mainly because it is a run down hotel uncomfortable and lacks the wow factor hotels around the central station are cheaper and in better condition although it feels that they are not really in town but are only seconds from the central station which means that for a day ticket you can go pretty much every where in town faster and with less walking ,negative,2,2,1,1

dreadful we stayed at this hotel based on another website s reviews whilst it is close to chinatown and next door to the captitol theatre it has small  dog kennel sized rooms hard beds  i mean worn out not firm  cleaning standard is less than that of a backpackers we stayed in backpackers which have been better i have stayed in may hotels in sydney and have had better experiences at a cheaper price this hotel should be more around the 60 per night mark oh if you like noise and thin walls this is the place for you with an irish pub right underneath going on friday to the wee hours of the morning sydney does love to show off the sirens the government has paid for on the police and fire vehicles and these pass right up george street every hour at least the rydges in camperdown an old hotel near the hospital is much better ,negative,0,0,1,2
good location but not sure i d stay there again booked this hotel on line and asked for a non smoking room upon entering the room it was evident that it was a smoking room  there was an ashtray sitting on the tv  my husband went down to reception and complained about the smell  we were quickly moved to a larger non smoking room bathrooms are very small and there was no water pressure in the shower breakfast was okay  the reception area is very small and looks like it needs a revamp and not very impressive and if there are lots of people checking in it gets very cramped i have stayed at better hotels nearby for the same price ,negative,4,0,2,3
perfect location slightly above average hotel i booked capitol square due to it s price and location i wanted a basic but clean hotel right in the city that is exactly what i got  not much more the staff were very friendly and helpful the lady at reception gave me great ideas on where to sitesee and how to get around the room was small but nicely decorated didn t try the food but i checked out the breakfast buffet and it looked good the only negative is the cleaning  my room appeared to be cleaned thoroughly when i arrived but i went to have a bath and noticed long dark hairs in the tub  yuck however in spite of the cleaning misfortune i would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a hotel with no frills inexpensive and centrally located ,positive,5,4,4,5
a superior pension this was a hotel that i was booked into as part of a group i would not choose to stay here there is a reception area only on the ground with just one lift to serve the whole building there is a breakfast room on the second floor where you can get a very reasonable breakfast for 10 the room was too small there was not enough storage space for both of us so i had to keep my clothes in my case in the bathroom the mirror is inadequately lit so i could not see adequately when i shaved its main virtue is that it is very centrally located being just off george street  ,negative,4,3,3,0
avoid this terrible hotel    me and a friend had the misfortune of staying at this hotel the location is rubbish  there is nothing of interest nearby there is only one lift for the entire hotel to use which is utterly ridiculous the receptionist is extremely rude  he doesn t even bother to say hello when you greet him when you walk into the hotel the first thing you see is tons of luggage lying around as there is no storage room anyone can walk off with somebody else s suitcase the rooms was very small  the floorboards creak and the reception on the tv was appalling  unwatchable the beds are uncomfortable the hotel was freezing  we had to wrap up before going to have breakfast in the mornings if you want to check in early or check out late  forget it  they charge you astronomical rates  complete ripoff the walls are thin and you hear the people staying in the room next door even the breakfast was mediocre this is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at i would not stay there again if they paid me avoid at all costs you have been warned ,negative,1,0,1,1

nickel and dime the hotel itself was nice the room was ok upon entering you got the slight smell of mustiness the carpet had small snags in it and there were no rca connections on the tv to hook up a dvd player there were 2 bottles of water on the table with a 5 price tag on each which would be billed to your room if you drank them which i thought was a joke the shower was missing some caulking around the tub and i think they stopped making that pink shower tile back in the 80 the electronic keys i had for the room only worked after trying each of them numerous times paying 9 95 for internet service per day was ridiculous when you can get it free at all starbucks and best westerns and the daily self parking fee of 24 dollars was a joke even though it is quoted at 22 in the black guest book in the room and to top everything off upon checking out i assumed the price i was quoted and booked online included all fees but i was informed it did not include the daily 13 hotel tax which i had to pay it seems that this hotel is more worried about getting you in the door at a reasonable room rate so they can nickel and dime you into getting a second job not unlike home depot in my opinion if they took as much time paying attention to there guests as they do charging you for any and everything this hotel would be a nicer place to stay not a sermon just a thought ,negative,0,2,2,2

kyoto grand hotel failed to honor our confirmed reservations we had confirmed reservations since june of 2008 for our stay at the kyoto grand hotel but when we arrived after a long flight from florida at about 4 pm in the afternoon of october 27 2008 we were turned away from the hotel they refused to honor our reservations claiming the hotel was oversold instead they sent us to the wilshire hotel which would not have been our choice as a result we do not have a good opinion of the hotel and cannot comment on the accommodations because there were none it was extremely disappointing to be turned away after we had held long standing reservations that had been confirmed twice by the hotel we urge travelers to seek out more relaible hosts i would be happy to share my experience withother travelers ,negative,0,0,1,1
clean good service and convenient to downtown booked this directly using corporate rate rooms were clean and updated good for business traveler who is not looking for frills  the bathroom was tiny and the tub was flimsy fiberglass we had good service from front desk concierge but witnessed other travelers having difficulty getting into their reserved rooms in a timely manner what we liked best was the proximity to downtown and the ease of getting on and off the highway from the hotel would definitely stay here again for business travel ,positive,4,3,3,3
the kyoto grand was a disaster it seemed as if they bent over backwards to do everything the could to ruin our stay we had a large wedding party and the staff was rude neglectful and oblivious to our concerns and needs i will never stay at this hotel again and would discourage anyone else from staying there ,negative,0,0,0,1
not great neighborhood we spent 2 nights there don t use the parking there there are public parkings for 8 just next to it even if you go out with your car twice it would still be cheaper to park in the public parking and meters only run until 6pm which is good enough when you come back from dinner or whatever you were doing the room was comfortable but not as modern as advertised and the neighborhood was not great although you can get anywhere from there with a car of course as it is central enough there is nothing going on downtown la so why insist to choose a downtown hotel  ,negative,3,0,0,0
not happy with my stay the kyoto grand was totally overpriced for what is was the rooms  supposedly recently remodeled were outdated especially the bathroom  the sink fixtures barely worked and the bathtub was dirty parking was a complete ripoff  we were told it was 24 00 per 24hr period for selfparking but upon check out we were charged for 3 days even though we only parked for 2 24hr periods the front desk was totally unhelpful and refused to reverse the charge there are plenty of other hotels in downtown la that i would try before returning here i don t recommend it ,negative,0,0,1,1
do not stay at the kyoto grand hotel ever everything is overpriced for no apparent reason 30 00 per day for valet parking 8 50 for 4 copies in the business center 74 00 for room service breakfast for 3 people  bacon was burnt and juice choices were wrong average cost for 3 people at any restaurant in the place is 125 00 website lists shuttle service available  not available inhouse literature lists limo service availablenot on tuesday when i needed it also no availability to order movies i left a day early because i asked to speak to the manager and he never called this place is a nightmare ,negative,1,1,1,1
okay   i had stayed here several times when it was still the new otani but this was my visit under the new name management the new otani had been a solid 3star hotel but i had high expectations for this visit perhaps because of the new name  kyoto grand hotel  maybe because of those high expectations i was quite disappointed the hotel lobby is not spectacular but very nice our room however was at a 2star level there were numerous stains on the carpet and the bathroom in particular was quite rundown of course it s all about price value in that regard i feel that it was a good deal based on the 127 night price i got through orbitz i would be very disappointed ath the regular price of 190 to 200 night ,negative,0,0,3,0
rooms were noisy and area was ghetto was in los angeles on vacation with my family of four and found this hotel  back then it was new otani for a reasonable 150 night the room was rather cramped with 2 double beds and the walls were thin the worst part was that because of its downtown location there were many helicopters flying around that made it hard for me to sleep the tea garden sounds nice but in reality is rather small and not exactly a long romantic stroll not much in the area and so like much of la you ll need a car to get around the staples center and koreatown are only a 5 minute drive away and there s a small japanese plaza with a couple restaurants and shops within walking distance i would not recommend unless you got it really cheap ,negative,2,2,2,2
wonderful experience highly recommend  spent a delightful 5 days here had 2 days of biz in downtown la and decided to add some time on either side of that love the location in little tokyo staff very helpful and friendly housekeeping was lovely and on top of all details had excellent experience at hair salon in hotel and i cannot give high enough reviews for the shiatsu massage truly exceptional massage at the health spa facility which is on the hotel property but a separate entity from hotel superlative sushi close by too ,positive,5,5,5,5
nothing special but few real problems i spent five nights here recently while attending a convention i have not been a frequent visitor to la so i was surprised how uninteresting and deserted the downtown area is at night there seemed to be very little in the immediate vicinity though little tokyo is a few blocks walk away the hotel itself as you can guess from its name has a japanese theme but my room showed no such influences it was a standard westernstyle kingbed room the amenities were ok but the overall impression is bland and predictable a few minor complaints  some of the lamps were not working and neither were the payperview movies the latter didn t bother me but the problems suggest that routine quality checks are not carried out i didn t use room service or the inhouse restaurants there is a cocktail and sake bar called genji a sushi and tempura bar and a steak seafood restaurant they looked expensive and if japanese food is your thing i suspect you can find a lot better and cheaper within a few blocks of the hotel if you are staying here and don t have a car try pete s cafe and bar  about three blocks away and a great place ,negative,1,1,1,3
kyoto is trying    corner room bathroom outdated first night bottom sheet made short bug bite corner not cleaned with a wrapper left over from the night before parking 24 night  but good area hotel is trying free shuttle within 2 miles of the hotel if you ask for it and nearby sake and beer if cost is close i would spend the night in historical downtown ,negative,0,0,3,0
a unique and pleasant la hotel i had stayed in the kyoto grand hotel one other time about 23 years ago  when it was called new otani  the hotel has clearly improved i didn t have any significant problems with it before but it s clear that the rooms and the lobby have been renovated and they have stayed faithful to the japanese decor that makes the hotel and the area so unique don t be afraid to walk outside the hotel and around little tokyo it s a nice little area with some good japanese restaurants in the room the view was nice and the japanese sliding screens on the windows were a nice touch also it s nice to have the minifridge the bathroom was very clean but still needs some updating the tile around the bath tub is a gaudy pink color and although i liked the handheld shower head it wouldn t stay in the right position when i put it on the hook the faucet at the sink was difficult to operate and get a good temperature i will also insert my usual complaint about extra fees including 24 for selfparking however overall the hotel was a great place to stay and another great deal  80 winning bid on priceline  ,positive,4,0,3,3
kyoto grand was grand we stayed there five days wonderful corner room with huge windows overlooking l a  lovely decor highly functional room with safe fridge effective a c windows that open very responsive friendly and polite staff every single time good food  breakfast buffet with omlette station lunch at the azelia restaurant one of three on the premises lovely gardens spent time there relaxing reading attached starbucks made it even better good average rate great location this one s a nobrainer for our next stay ,positive,5,3,3,5
dont consider for weekend stays   i realize that downtown la is not a hotspot by any means  that being said we stayed on a saturday for a friend s wedding and of the four places to eat in the hotel only one was open and the menu was not very exciting my noodle bowl was delicious but everything else was below average imagine my shock when for three people the bill came to 100 that seems a bit pricey for two noodle bowls and a hamburger and some fries we decided to get a drink before the wedding but the bar wasn t open in the hotel until well into the evening the rooms were average size but the bathroom needed some upgrading all the tiles in the shower were cracked  broken this wasn t the worst hotel i stayed in but i wouldn t recommend it either ,negative,1,1,1,1
great hotel and nice staff the hotel was in a great location and the staff was very helpful i checked in very late and they made me feel like i was coming home the room was nice with an excellent view we had drinks in the bar with  moe great service the restaurant had a great buffet for lunch and we loved the restaurants on the 3rd floor i travel 45 weeks a year and when i come to la i will stay at the kyoto grand there is something to be said about good service a clean room and staying with people who care thanks rich,positive,5,5,4,4

great hotel loved the palomar funky decor and comfortable rooms the staff could not have been nicer it s not often that my husband and i want to hang out in the lobby but that is exactly what we did during the free happy hour they even gave us a free ride to the restaurant for dinner parking was expensive but the valet s were very efficient centrally located and right off the freeway ,positive,5,0,5,5
wonderful hotel i made reservations at the palomar partly because of the good reviews here it exceeded our expectations nice room everything looked new and spotlessly clean neat modern arty decor we got a complimentary upgrade to a room with beautiful view of la from the 17th floor the bed was big and comfy with a bunch of fluffy pillows and a really warm comforter  actually too warm  most comfortable bed i ve ever slept on in a hotel the staff was great we didn t need them much but they were friendly helpful and efficient when we did the two nights we were there the room was extremely quiet probably due to the high floor we were on and not many people being around some people have noted that the a c is very noisy in our room it wasn t we could hear it turning on but the sound was not loud by any stretch nice touches  42 lcd hd tv large room safe plush bath robes high quality shampoo conditioner the hotel is in a good location we caught a movie at the theatre a safe two block walk away or you can walk to westwood village drive down wilshire blvd and there are a ton of stores and restaurants hop on the freeway to the getty center  which we did and had a great time or santa monica beach a few nits  you cannot control the water flow in the sink faucet only the temperature more than a few times i ended up splashing water all over the place due to the high water pressure you hang up towels to reuse but they get replaced anyway parking is 30 a day valet only that didn t bother me much though given the low room rate we got the aaa rate of 161 a night on a holiday weekend what a great deal we really enjoyed our stay highly recommended ,positive,5,0,5,5
exceeded my expectations the hotel exceeded my expectations it was a great value and ideally located the staff were very attentive to our needs from checkin 2 checkout it was fantastic to be able to walk outside and be centrally located the rooms were tasteful comfortable very well mainted and super clean blvd 16 offered fantastic food and service i plan to stay there again ,positive,5,5,5,5

great hotel stayed here for a 4day girl s weekend and had a great time rooms are clean and decor is great  very la the rooms and bathrooms are also a decent size so there is room for two girl s suitcases shopping etc while still allowing room to move the lobby has a nice sophisticatedbutcomfortable vibe and there are all types who stay here  couples families business travellers and those on trips with friends and there are also pets  we were startled by a beautiful golden retriever when we got off the elevator one morning service is very good overall  attentive friendly and very helpful the concierge paul made some great recommendations for a saturday night out including aoc which we didn t realize until afterwards was such a highlyregarded restaurant he also gave tips on when to arrive at bar marmont so that we could be sure to enjoy the saturday night vibe and miss the line a few small things room service although 24 hour is expensive and the restaurant closes around 10 or 11 so come prepared if you get in on a late flight there is also a very limited night menu  from 11 pm or 12 to 6 am  also seems that there are a fair number of new staff right now they are all trying hard and doing a great job but some of them don t yet have a good knowledge of the area sights and some processes  like an early morning checkout  were a little slow but everyone is keen and friendly  the most important thing this hotel is in a nice area but you do have to walk a bit to get to shopping etc but it s la so to be expected  just about anyone visiting the city should be prepared to rent a car valet parking is 30 day a little pricey but definitely cheaper than the downtown areas of a lot of major cities  san fran ny we didn t look into other parking options so don t know if selfpark is available overall a great stay for two girls looking for a fun weekend ,positive,5,3,3,4
excellent service this was our first time at this hotel and on arrival was pleasantly surprised to find that the manager was from another los angeles hotel that i had stayed in some years back and more surprised that he remembered us the hotel itself  excellent location and the room as clean and well taken care of the service and helpfulness of the staff management were perfect and professional  thanks again for helping us arrange reservations for dinner and your suggestions on some things to do in westwood we will definitely be coming back in december and look forward to staying with you again regards g e a  ,positive,5,0,4,5
the finest hotel in la for it s price just add self parking option we stayed three nights in the palomar hotel in westwood mostly based on location an attractive 50 off offer on expedia and its 1 ranking on tripadvisor and this is sure the ranking this former doubletree hotel now stylish renovated by kimpton deserves not just for the big spotless rooms with countless amenities like a huge lcd tv and the best king i ve slept on during my whole 4 week stay in the usa or the excellent location  just minutes away from beverly hills santa monica and ucla in a safe neighboorhood most of all this hotel is my new la favorite spot because of the most attentive and truly friendly staff from front office to bell and valet everybody gives you that warm welcome feeling like you are at home and will do almost everything to make your stay as pleasant as possible i cannot remember any other hotel on the many trips i ve made to the usa where i found a similar experience they even offer a complimentary wine hour but we were to busy exploring la to join  only thing missing was a balcony to enjoy the streetlife or hotel view and the wifi reception was unfortunality rather bad but nevertheless this hotel would be my choice again next time  hopefully again with a good expedia offer  cause their rack rates are kinda pricy for me though worth the money  final remark is that the hotel parking is also pricy  usd 30 overnight and they only offer valet service as an european i d prefer to do the parking myself  although the valets are most attentive but i simply find self parking more comfortable so it would be perfect if the hotel would offer self parking too their indoor parking lot is huge and the infrastructure surely allows possibility of self parking ,positive,5,5,5,5
wonderful stay exceptional staff great location usually stayed in west hollywood but heard from a friend about this place in westwood tried it out and found everything from the welcoming front desk folks to the housekeepers not to mention the fabulous bed made it one of the nicest hotel stays i ve experienced in a long time   and i just stayed at the st regis in new york ,positive,5,0,5,5
loved it from the minute we arrived the staff was extremely gracious and helpful check in was a breeze and advice from the concierge was very helpful on what to do in the area and how to get around town i booked a vista deluxe room and was not disappointed in the least bed was comfy room was quiet nice big tv nice bathroom good water pressure in shower   all good one of my friends booked a spa suite it was awesome i have to admit i was just a bit jealous   we hung out with our friends one night in the hotel restaurant blvd 16 and had a great time and tried most of the appetizers which were great i wish we would have given the entrees a try but maybe next time   the chef even came over and took a minute to sit with us he mentioned that the hotel is also pet friendly which we didn t know it was nice to run into someone who loves dogs as much as we do all in all a great experience at the palomar i would recommend to anyone ,positive,0,5,5,5
not quite found its soulless yet let me firstly say that there is nothing wrong at all about this hotel it is in excellent condition  quite new i believe  the staff are friendly and helpful and the room we had was absolutely fine  especially the bed it just seems to lack an identity and character which i expect will comein time the location is not great as it sits on the busy wilshire boulevard  not noisy inside though and it is a good walk to find somewhere to eat if you want to step out rather than eat in the restaurant which is soulless the best place to go is up towards ucla forget the pool  it seems to be an afterthought and barely gets the sun ,positive,5,1,4,5
terrible we stayed in a king bed suite for 5 nights after reading the reviews on trip advisor what a nightmare the hotel is located at the center of everything the rooms are okay but the noise is terrible  none of us could sleep all night  the ac was too loud and we were given the top floor so the room was very hot and we were not able to use the ac because of the noise  the road noise was the worst every single second we were able to here the traffic it is not worth the money the front desk staff were very indifferent to our problem please don t stay in this hotelhannah  ,negative,5,0,1,1
way too expensive for what you get beware the expense does not end with the room charge for a famiy of 4 to sightsee in la we booked this hotel because of its central location my husband is a frequent business traveler la and says that downtown is not safe at night we balked a little at spending more than 300 but figured we d have this super room for the price we got a average sized room with artsy furniture the room was not ready when we arrived and the toilet would not work unless you took off the top of the tank to manually flush it we were shocked at the 30 day parking we made the mistake of ordering a pot of coffee and 4 ojs one morning and couldn t believe the charge was more than 60  in summary it is a nice hotel but i don t think you get what you pay for i ve stayed in much nicer hotels for less i would not go back there unless someone else was paying the bill ,negative,0,0,1,2
westwood winner stayed at the hotel palomar in westwood for three nights earlier this month for a business trip and absolutely loved it got a great rate for a comfortable clean and stylish room staff is especially eager to help without coming off condescending or pretentious especially loved the free happy hour  they were generous with the wine pours  and the ipod docking station alarm clock since i was here on business the free internet access was also appreciated unfortunately i didn t bring a camera to take pictures of the place to attach to this review but actually i think the pictures they have on their website are very accurate ,positive,0,0,5,5
nice  modern hotel the hotel palomar is the latest location in the kimpton group s chain of boutique hotels all of the distinctive kimpton touches are there  evening wine reception premium morning coffee very comfortable bed l occitane toiletries great upscale restaurant onsite the westwoodarea hotel is easily accessed on wilshire blvd  which is good since most area restaurants and shops will require a drive  or at least a very long walk  everything looked new which makes sense as the hotel was extensively renovated and has only been open as a palomar for three months the staff seemed friendly and eager but unpolished  i generally don t expect to hear the terms  cool and  awesome being used by the staff during checkin  the rooms seemed somewhat smaller than usual but were clean and included both very nice details  42 flat panel television chaise lounge ample lighting with touch controls and disappointing shortcuts  no hd on the tv cheapish furniture  during my stay i was able to enjoy a dinner at blvd 16 the combination restaurant lounge just off the lobby the food was good the service was very attentive and the atmosphere was festivethe restaurant was still quite busy at 10 at night overall i enjoyed my stay and recommend the palomar particularly if you like your hotel with lots of  attitude  ,positive,4,5,4,4
simply the best   we have just left the hotel what a wonderful experience   the hotel is brand new and the staff is incredibly helpful our room a king deluxe was decorated with design furniture and in the wardrobe we found bathrobes  roberto cavalli style  in the lobby you can have a cup of coffee in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening the location is also great westwood is quiet but near all the attractions don t forget to plan a visit to the getty musuem the view is stunning   ,positive,5,5,5,5
not so great stayed four nights and wasn t terribly impressed rooms are nicely decorated and the bed is comfortable but rooms not overly large and somewhat noisy poor cable without many channels they have large flat screen tv s but analog picture quality and no hd the staff is inconsistent at best turn down serivce occurred the first and last nights but not the middle two the restaurant brought me the wrong order twice at breakfast on the thrid try the eggs were overcooked but i ate them anyway the bar charges 8 drink and doesn t even have nuts or nibbles even for a fee much less complimentary the sole choice is a 12 plate of olives not too tasty with a margarita it has a superficial ecofriendliness but changes the towels daily no matter where you hang them the hallways are kept about 60 degrees and of course the hotel windows don t open the water faucets do not permit you to adjust the rate of flow so it is always full force ,negative,0,1,3,2
a disappointment what a terrible experience new paint carpets and a few pieces of cool furniture can t disguise the inherent shortcomings of this renovated hotel  i am told it used to be a doubetree and that s the level it remains at  the rooms are too small the ac is so loud you want to cover your ears the whole time you are in the room and the walls are so thin that even if you turn yours off you ll hear your neighbor s ac  not to mention their bathroom visits  and don t get me started on the pool tucked away in what feels like an alley behind the hotel  between the hotel s dumpster and the washing facility  with a grand total of five sunbathing chairs  try fighting for one on a saturday afternoon  and a bunch of shared couches half the equipment in the fitness center fails to work properly true the staff are friendly but this boutique hotel is a joke ,negative,1,0,1,5
glad we got the grand opening rate   not worth the regular price my husband and i love kimpton hotels so we were super excited to see this one opening in la right before my sisters wedding so much so that we also had a dozen of our friends and family book here too the hotel is gorgeous and the location is great too we only had breakfast in the restaurant and that was really good our major complaint is with the hotels willingness to problem solve and accommodate guests when a problem does occur our problem had to do with the crib provided for our infant daughter it was not adequete and the hotel s website claimed to have cribs specifically for infants which it did not also the crib was not in our room when we checked in at midnight so it added to the stress of traveling with an infant that late at night when we complained to the hotel staff the person we spoke with said that she was sorry but that she didn t have children so couldn t understand what we were complaining about the gm contacted us as well after we made several attempts to resolve the matter with the hotel staff he clearly had been misinformed because he criticized us for wanting a crib bumper  which we did not want     if we had the time to spend our entire trip playing phone tag in the hopes to connect with someone that was willing to fix the problem we would have but we were there for a wedding and had things to do on a seperate note   i m not sure what the hotel is doing to qualify as eco friendly since the light bulbs in the lamps aren t even the eco friendly variety and the water faucets are the kind that only have temperature control and not volume control overall we were extremely dissapointed with the service of the hotel and would not recommend it to a friend nor would we be likely to stay in another kimpton hotel in the future ,negative,5,1,1,1
a dissenting opinion we booked this hotel prior to its opening and from the information available it appeared to be only a block away from westwood village and fairly close to ucla the hotel is actually at least a 15 minute walk from westwood village it is located in a stretch of highrise condos and apartments on wilshire with not even so much as a coffee shop or convenience store within a close walk unless you get a suite expect a very very small room ours was so small that we did not have room to put up two suitcase stands worse the pillows were rockhard we called down for feather pillows without success and i finally had to go down to search for a couple of softer pillows as for the kimpton amenities the afternoon wine and cheese reception was only wine and little bowls of mixed nuts the morning light breakfast was only tea and coffee with no food of any kind for business travelers beware the kimpton wifi access it is not a secure network all in all it was a complete disappointment we checked out after one night and fled to the downtown omni which was heaven virginia traveler  ,negative,3,2,1,1
fab hotel loved this hotel  beautiful decor and rooms luxurious staff very helpful and friendly and restaurant and bar very chic location excellent and within easy walking distance of bars and restaurants in westwood village had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend this hotel ,positive,5,0,4,5
i recommend this hotel to everyone i have stayed at several kimpton hotels and all are good when i stayed at the westwood palomar i had my golden retriever trevor with me everyone from the front desk clerk derek to the valet attendant keri was very friendly and accomodiating the decor is beautiful and the food in the restaurant is excellent i had the chicken on greens it was delicious i would stay here again and the hotel is beautiful i loved the location my friends who live in los angeles have been back for dinner and the quality is consistant would not hesitate to stay here again ,positive,0,5,5,5

great stay at the omni i spent 2 nights at the omni in downtown la during a recent business trip this was my first time to stay at an omni andi was very pleased the staff at the front desk and the bellhops were very courteous and efficient the bellhop filled my ice bucket up for me withoutbeing asked i was very pleased with my room it had nice decor and waswell maintained the bathroom was very large and had a seperate shower and tub the bed was extremely comfortable i stay at sheraton s quite often and this bed was more comfortable than the sheraton heavenly sleeper the pillows were the best i have ever slept on the had a mixture of bothfirm and soft and large and small pillows i was very pleased with my stay here and would highly recomend this hotel to anyone who needs to be in the downtown la area ,positive,5,5,5,5
good hotel the omni is a good hotel the rooms tend to be clean and comfortable staff tends to be responsive to customer issues the gym is modern the only real concern was there is a charge to use the computer at the business center that is a little disappointing considering the high tariff at the hotel on the whole i would say that this is probably one of your better options in los angeles hopefully my main concern is resolved in the future so guests can have real business center access ,positive,0,0,4,4
an excellent start to our holiday care of the omni this hotel is great we got a great deal through expedia by booking alongside our flights and were kind of spoiled as this set an early bar for the rest of our holiday from dropping the car off with the valet to check in  which was smooth and efficient we had a first class experience here and would recommend it to anyone with easy access to the subway links which was a very inexpensive way for us to travel without having to once use the car  it a little dark around the entrance to the subway at night next to the park but was ok to walk briskly past at night back towards the hotel  we used the subway to get to universal and hollywood boulevard from which we were able to walk to the hollywood bowl the room was spacious comfortable and felt new and was a delight to return to after a long day in and around various parts of la the bathroom was roomy and had a great shower we had breakfast in the restaurant the first morning but found it a little expensive to indulge in every morning so we made do with the starbucks which was onsite which was a great way for us to start the day sign up to select guest on their website before you go this enables you to free wifi internet access in your room in conclusion don let the location of this hotel put you off the subway was easy and cheap and we found it a lovely base in almost five star surroundings ,positive,5,4,5,5
couldn t be more satisfied i stayed for 4 nights in late august i got this hotel through a package deal i have to agree with those that gave the hotel great reviews i utilized the online check in and our keys were waiting for us upon our arrival allowing us to bypass checking in with the front desk like others i highly recommend signing up for the select guest program the complimentary beverages in the morning are a nice way to start off each day and the turndown service is a nice way to end the day amy their concierge was top notch she was very helpful with suggestions and providing directions to places we wanted to go and she did this without us having to ask and while it was 30 day i wasn t too upset because frankly we were on vacation and that s come to be a normal expectation and they were quick and prompt we never had to wait long for the car on the last night we weren t getting any hot water and i contacted the front desk upon our return from the evening out the front desk manager gary informed us that the problem was still not fixed taken proactive measures he gave us access to another room to take a shower the next morning and comped up 2 days parking for the inconvenience last but not least it was in a great location with easy access to the i101we stayed at the omni san diego as part of our trip as well and there is no comparison omni la at california plaza s service lived up to it s fourstar rating ,positive,5,5,5,5
loved the omni this hotel was central to all of the attractions we wanted to see in la there were free nightly shows downtown for my teenage sons they both loved the shows i think sesame street world was showing the hotel staff was very helpful the beds were so soft i did not want to leave my only complaint is the extra cost for refridge pay extra and no microwave other than the 30 00 per day in out parking i was very satisfied by the way you may be able to walk 1 2 block up olive and get in out parking much cheaper if you don t mind the 1 2 block stroll ,positive,5,0,4,4
horrible service the front desk service and the hostess for the grand cafe were rude simply posed questions easily confused the staff who responded with arrogance really 80 of the staff could use a lot customer service training the valet staff were the only decent people the pictures are good but inaccurate the room was simple and small and the water smells like sulfur i would never stay at an omni hotel again ,negative,0,0,1,1
great hotel       late afternoon view from room,positive,0,0,0,0
average  wouldn t stay again we stayed at the omni for 2 nights in august overall the stay was ok the rooms were really big felt like an apartment but the location is terrible if your in town to work in teh cbd then fantastic but if your a tourist then there is no point in staying downtown as everything is at least a 510 minute drive away and you have to pay for parking i found the omni dated and felt like something more suitable for the elderly it was old fashioned and the decor really outdated i wouldn t stay here again we ended up forgoing out last night s prepaid accommodation and stayed in beverly hills simply for the location ,negative,1,0,1,1
fab hotel i could not fault this hotel it was fabulous excellent location  i did not have a car and was alittle worried that this would be a problem it wasn t this hotel was expensive in comparison to other hotels i stayed in on my one month vacation in america but by la standards wasn t that bad and you definitely got value for money the room was luxourious  spotlessly clean food was great  i didn t try breakfast though it was a bit full on and pricey  i m not a big eater in the morning  they have a well equiped gym  headphones towels water  fruit all provided free of charge  outdoor pool with loungers and the staff could not have been more pleasant i would definitely recommend this hotel for a vacation in la ,positive,5,0,4,4
handsome hotelgreat food and location the omni hotel is definitely a standout hotel among the ones i ve been too in la it s located right in downtown la and the views from the room let you see all of it rooms are quite large and i feel like they are decorated like your own bedroomnot a standard basic hotel room there are two good restaurants one is a little more luxurious but both have really good food there a huge pool outside with nice lounge chairs also the fitness center is very nice and has a lot of machines i d say it s a great place for everyone business travelers in particular i took a video of my stay and it shows more of what i was talking about http  www tripfilms com travelvideov64421losangelestheomnihotelvideo html ,positive,5,5,5,5
very nice would stay here again a very nice hotel with a reasonable downtown la price in the safe part of downtown and within easy walking distance of many places to eat not a lot of shopping nearby but the jewelry district is about 2 blocks away if you are into that the room was clean comfortable and quiet staff was curteous and helpful the breakfast was quite expensive but wonderful i didn t like the entry to the room the closet and bath doors bumped against each other and it felt like you were squeezing your way in also the tv was dated and small  it s time for a flat screen upgrade omni both minor issues i liked the property and would stay here again ,positive,4,4,4,5
nice place to stay for downtown la i ve stayed at practically every downtown hotel in l a and this one is up on top of my list the service is absolutely spoton for business travelers they are quick courteous and friendly you just can t ask for much more than that the rooms are standard business fare and you will find no surprises it s clean and roomy enough to work the restaurant does a good breakfast buffet with pretty much anything you need the prices are typical business rates i wouldn t recommend this hotel if you are a tourist due to it s location away from the rest of downtown it s a good hike to the staple center and the convention hall so if you need to go there you may want to find another place if you are there on business it s the place to be ,positive,3,5,5,5
good hotel friendly helpful staff good hotel in downtown la room was spacious and clean and met all our needs however i do find it hard to believe that this is the number 1 hotel in la as i have stayed in nicer properties in past ruben the barman made our stay  i must recommend his lemon frop cocktails   ,positive,0,0,4,5
lovely hotel   gorgeous luxurious hotel nice rooms  helpful staff they even have a car to take you where you like for free  when i was there anyway  its situated downtown though so i would not recommend for tourists as its no where near sunset boulevard etc you can still book trips for pick up from the omni but in my opinion its too far out most of the people around were business people staying in the hotel ,positive,3,0,0,5
omni all the way the omni los angeles is a safe place to stay in los angeles  and that s from a new jerseyian  it provides a classy atmosphere and is home to some of the most professional staff i ve ever encountered their services and hospitality are unmatched the conceirge was always willing to help decide where to eat what to do and even make reservations for us the location is also within walking distance to the disney concert hall and surrounding coffee shops casual eateries convenience stores and of course starbucks the outdoor pool could use some work but it s heated and even in april la was a bit chilly for the beach overall the hotel was a steal for the price and location ,positive,5,0,5,5
great hotel my wife and i booked 2 nights at the omni for a weekend stay this was a nice property with excellent service from the moment we checked in until the time we checked out the service was great we arrived early and the hotel was able to make arrangements for us to check in an hour early the gal at guest service was very friendly and helpful she told us about different restaurants to eat at in the area everyone we dealt with at the hotel was very friendly and helpful we went to a lakers game on friday which was a 10 cab ride from the hotel the hotel is only about 7 miles from the hollywood area so it was easy to get to from the hotel we had some drinks at the noe restaurant which was nice and relaxing the room was very spacious with a large bathroom the bed was very comfortable we were very impressed with omni and would definately return if we are in the los angeles area ,positive,4,0,0,5
good hotel in downtown the omni is a good hotel nothing spectacular but it meets all your needs nicely for downtown la well positioned close to disney hall the cathedral etc the place was pricey even with a group discount the room was clean and well furnished but to be honest i was a bit surprised that this was rated the top hotel in la ,positive,0,0,2,0

omni downtown la is very hard to beat i stayed at the omni for 2 nights and i have to say that this is one of the nicest hotel stays i ve had in some time i picked up a tip from this website and signed up for omni s selectguest program online it s free and easy to do if you sign up for that you get free wifi in your hotel room when you stay at an omni as well as a free newspaper of your choice every am and a free am beverage of your choice both delivered to your door it s worth doing the omni emailed me a day before my trip offering me the option of checking in online which i did as it happens i got out on a flight that was earlier than i thought and i arrived at the omni at 2pm i thought i would be too early to check in but not so my room was ready and all i had to do was pick up my room key in an envelope with my name on it at the front desk and i was good to go very quick and easy the room was very large with bed armchair  ottoman desk and a couch as well as the obligatory tv minibar armoir unit the bathroom was also quite large with a tub and a separate glassenclosed shower the room was reminiscent of some stays i ve at the four seasons but not nearly as expensive i stayed thursday and friday nights the thursday rate was 179 and the friday rate was 249 so that averages to 215 per night i think there is a spa gym on the 4th floor with a pool long enough to swim laps in which most hotels do not have i m guessing it was 45 feet x 15 feet everything was clean everyone was polite and everything went smoothly i had dinner one night at a japanese restaurant called sai sai which is a couple of blocks away and that restaurant has fantastic sushi it was some of the best sushi i ve had rivaling even the superlatively great sushi restaurant of northern california sushi ran located in sausalito i can t think of anything negative to say about the omni la if you need to be downtown i don t think you can find a nicer hotel even if you pay a lot more ,positive,5,5,5,5
i read the reviews and it was as good as they said i flew to los angeles from vancouver in november 2007 to attend a concert by legendary pianist martha argerich  and she showed up    i used trip advisor to look for a hotel since i don t know anyone in la i considered several less expensive hotels all within walking distance of the walt disney concert hall but was finally convinced to book at the omni because the reviews are very favourable compared to the others the hotel service and location was excellent and really made my stay a great experience we ate at the hotel s award winning noe restaurant before walking across the street to the concert hall after the concert we had a drink at the hotel lounge the following day we went to the museum of contemporary art also next door a taxi ride to the beverly mall was 60 return but it was premium shopping if you want to spend the money on taxi transportation to and from the airport and the door of the hotel was by super shuttle around 2230 each way so i saved on taxi money there the room was clean and quiet and had all the usual amenities the lady and man at the concierge helping visitors were pleasent  knowledgeable and patient it was a truly pleasurable experience i would book at the omni again and recommend it to anyone going to la and want to stay in the nice and safe financial district ,positive,5,0,5,5
love the personal touches booked my stay via an expedia package i m so impressed with this hotel that i have to write my first review on tripadvisor about it  and i just got back from my trip today  it s a big hotel but is still very serviceoriented and full of personal touches the staff is extremely polite and accommodating the room is comfy clean and wellappointed make sure that you join the omni select guest program before you check in and provide the hotel with your membership number you will get complimentary drinks and newspaper every morning free internet access and evening turndown services as well the valet parking is 28 a night but is a good deal compared to other downtown hotels which charge over 30 i am definitely going back to omni the next time i visit la ,positive,0,4,4,5
excellent i stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days in november this hotel is very lovely location is downtown la the parking was complimentary which was awesome  there really isn t a whole lot around the area but we were driving so it didn t matter the l a traffic wasn t even bad i m from ny so i know what hectic traffic can be like the rooms nice size beds were a well stocked mini bar  of course some items were ridiculously pricey  beautiful bathroom everything was clean and lovely room service though it took a bit was absolutely scrumptous staff was wonderful bar is located on 3rd fl this is a up class joint that was well worth the money i would stay here in again in a heartbeat       ,positive,0,0,5,4
disappointing as it was our first time in la we booked a hotel downtown and the omni seemed to fit the bill however we regret that we did not book somewhere hipper and livilier like in west hollywood we quickly learned that downtown is not somewhere that we wanted to walk around in the evening it was all very depressing and souless and felt a bit dangerous the hotel itself was fairly standard the kind of place i like to stay in on business but for pleasure i want something with more character which i have only myself to blame for as i had stayed in the omni before on business and found it efficient however there were other problemswe were very unhappy with valet parking there was an event on in the hotel one evening and we had to wait about 15 minutes on the street to drop our car off     message to hotel if you have an event on you need to get more staff and put your hotel guests first another irritation was that there was no safe in the room we had to desposit our valuables downstairs with the front desk which was inconvenient overall the omni la is a good hotel but definitely not for us ,negative,1,1,1,1
excellent service and comfortable stay at the omni stayed at the omni for two nights on business travel from the moment i arrived when the valet picked up my car to the moment i departed when the valet returned my car i experienced nothing but great customer service from omni s staff a first i was skeptical thinking that the staff was being nice to perhaps make up for less adequate rooms but when i opened the door to my room i found it to be clean comfortable and modern no dust or crumbs around the baseboards the mattress was high and firm the sheets were white and the beds were decorated with accent pillows the bathroom featured a separate shower and tub complimentary toilettries and clean white shower rugs i also used the fitness center and was impressed with the number and condition of the cardio machines most hotels have one or two machines that are terribly outdated the fitness center at the omni was spacious and featured elliptical machines treadmills with mini tvs and some machine and free weights the free weights were a little on the old side but the overall fitness room was more than what i expected further the omni has a courtesy car that can take you to any business location in the city i definitely recommend the omni if service cleanliness and amenities are of importance to you ,positive,0,0,5,5
probably the nicest hotel in downtown la the omni is considered the most upscale hotel in downtown los angeles having stayed at a couple of other downtown hotels i would say it is probably the best overall choice if cost is not an issue aside from one rude front desk employee  who later called back to apologize to his credit  the service is classy the rooms are standard sized with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms and the spa fitness center are very nice the location is great if you have a reason to stay in downtown la tip when booking your room request one with views of the muchtalkedabou walt disney concert hall designed by architect frank gehry ,positive,0,0,0,3
los angeles downtown location as always i chose the omni based on tripadvisor reviews that s why i feel it s important to write reviews  as a way of giving back to other reviewers and the tripadvisor website for their contributions to making my family trips the best that i can plan the omni is a great location for downtown los angeles touring it is two blocks from the music center where we attended a play close to koreatown where we shopped for great produce at one of the huge markets close to chinatown where we dined on dim sum close to our friends and family in the increasingly upscale silverlake district and close to many authentic mexican taquerias it is a beautiful hotel that was very busy on the weekend that we stayed  a testament to its popularity i believe the rooms were spacious and immaculate the bedding delightful and the bathroom well appointed with very good water pressure downsides telephone buttons didn t work well difficult to get the concierge and valet parking staff movie rental system didn t work consistently inhouse restaurant grand cafe had terrible service and soso food  but they deducted the cost of the entree that was not properly served thank you   not insurmountable downsides but perhaps a bit disappointing given the pricetag which is on the higher end ,positive,5,0,5,5
we were impressed with the omni arrived exhausted after long delayed flight impressive lobby area creating a good first impression efficient checkin room a fair size bathroom also spaciousseparate shower and bath went to bar to eat a relaxing atmosphere with pianist comfy leather sofas and low lighting service wasn t speedy but felt o k not to rush in these surroundings the outdoor tables overlooked the plaza where a free concert was taking place we were just too tired to fully appreciate beds extremely comfortableslept very well all 3 nights turndown service with chocolates and weather forecast first two days only teenaged son is a fussy eater so didn t want anything on hotel menu for breakfast went to see amy the efficient bubbly concierge who gave us a street map phoned hollywood bowl about a concert for us gave us metro information then went out to ask robert lovely man one of the hotel car drivers to take us to ihop for breakfast  excellent choice very clean and great staff we caught metro to hollywood where we spent all day and evening back to ihop in hotel car next day had to wait a short while to go however coming back took one hour from first phoning from ihop to arriving back at omni not too impressed went to collect hire car from union street station wow it s like going back in timewe loved it headed off to the beach no problems with valet parking except expensive but we only had car for one night can t comment on either restaurant except to say that noe looked like a very spacial place for couples to share a romantic meal overall we were impressed with the omni we were comfortable and treated well by all staff the hotel car issue was really the only complaint but we felt that was outweighed by far by all the positives location may have become a problem if we had been staying longer with no hire car however metro station was not too far away ,positive,3,4,4,4
nice hotel but a bad experience with valet parking i got a great rate through the hotel website the people checking me in were nice and the room was just fine was glad to have a pool if you re sound sensitive like me though you might notice that you can hear the vibration from mechanical things around the pool under  and for that matter above the water as it seems surrounded by big whirlynoise making things overall i had a fine stay room service was yummy but they didn t follow through on my request to leave it outside my door and i wasn t happy about that biggest bummer was that i was only there 1 night and my car bumper got dinged from the valet parking no response from management despite an attempt to contact them this was my first time at an omni and the car ding and nonresponse leaves a bad taste in my mouth i might not return to this hotel or just park my car myself if i do as for other omnis i d consider it just hope they have their parking better worked out or a manager who is responsive ,negative,0,0,3,1

comfortable stay we stayed for three nights my daughter husband and myself we found the room comfortable and as members of the omni select guest program we received complimentary morning beverages which was a great touch the hotel was convenient for the metro which we used to get to universal we were aware of the parking charge before check in and allied to the great rate we paid for the hotel it was still good value  we did all the touristy things as this was our first visit to l a and really enjoyed the warner brothers tour ,positive,0,0,4,5
very nice hotel  relax and enjoy very nice hotel rooms were clean and spacious and the price wasn t all that bad  granted i got it at a copr price it is right next to the disney hall of music and some other attractions and is smak dap in downtown internet access sucked though and they put me in a business room one would think that the internet access would have worked in that room that pissed me off a bit  ,positive,4,4,3,4
best possible hotel we stayed at the omni for 2 weeks and we loved every minute of it i have nothing bad to say about this hotel it has everything that you would ever want the staff are so friendly the room is immaculate the location is excellent and safe and its near the metro and buses etc so its really good if you dont have a car stay here if you want a good holiday if i ever get the chance to go back to los angeles then this is the only hotel that i will be staying in ,positive,5,0,0,5
great stay  i  ll be back the short stay i had at the omni was wonderful from helpful check in  to the nice quiet room  to the good room service food it was a nice plus to have use of the town car to get to my meeting room was very nice  beds were a bit high for a short person but nice and comfy once you got in the bathroom had both a shower and a separate tub  lots of amenities such as 2 wall hooks  great for steaming out my wrinkled suit only thing i could have used a bit more of  was counterspace in the bathroom but it was manageable i will be back ,positive,0,0,4,5
quality hotel i m often surprised at how overgenerous trip advisor reviews can be of some fairly ordinary hotels  hilgard house is rated way too high for example nice people and location but the rooms are 70 s relics but i would strongly disagree with the last very negative review of the omni los angeles this is a very high quality comfortable hotel i have stayed several times mostly for business both in ordinary rooms and at the club level and would rate all of those stays very highly service is not perfect but very professional and welcoming like all omni s the bathrooms are a bit larger with a separate bath and shower and countertops the bed with down comforter and mulitple down pillows was very nice comfortable and clean  not the typical ugly mulitcolored polyesterish and probablynotwashedinquiteawhile comforter i stayed 4 nights on the 16th floor club level  i had a good sized corner room with a direct view of the music center the disney hall city hall the museum of contemporary art and alas the large notsointeresting condominium building across the street there isn t a large amount of public space in the omni but what it is has is attractive downtown la while getting better can be hit and miss in terms of nightlife but the omni is quite central for downtown business activities and culture as has been often mentioned music theater art little tokyo etc are either next door or down the street the morning breakfast and afternoon snacks are good in the club room which also has 2 computer terminals and a color printer the people staffing the club room are very nice and very hardworking since they pour drinks help out with the computers clean up etc wireless internet access is also free for select guest members  which you can just join when you arrive if you want  in addition to coffee tea etc delivered each morning for select guests some small service issues  they delivered the wrong paper in the mornings but when i went to breakfast the wsj nyt and lat were all available so no big deal coffee was delivered to my door half of the days but again i went to breakfast each morning anyway so i didn t even bother to call and it was free most of the front desk personnel were good parking valets were very good i ve stayed at several of the downtown hotels  bonaventure biltmore new otani the grand etc  but the omni is my preferred hotel quieter nicer rooms more valets for parking and overall a higher quality hotel ,positive,5,5,5,5
this place is awful this hotel is depressing its a bare bones hotel the only saving grace is that the bedding is ok but the room is very plane and the bathroom stark i would not rate this a 4 star hotel ,negative,1,1,1,1
wonderful experience the hotel is by far the best hotel i ve ever stayed at my boyfriend and i booked a standard room via priceline com for a great price   around 80 night after taxes i ve paid full price at many other 34 star hotels but none of them can beat the omni the room was not big at all   to be honest it was pretty small but still for me to love the room and the experience you ll have to believe it was really that great the down comforter was soooooo fluffy and there were pillows all over the bed the shower had a speaker radio so you can listen to the tv while in there if you re only looking to pay for a standard room the size is perfect if you re looking to stay in bed all day watch tv hang out etc it s not big enough if you re planning to bring children along i forgot how much parking was i think it was around 15 night but there are in and outs there s not much to do in downtown l a  but you can walk next door and visit the museum of contemporary arts  moca or drive a couple miles to little tokyo   on saturdays little tokyo has a small farmer s market other times you can visit the little tokyo s branch of the moca have lunch shop around enjoy ,positive,0,0,5,5
great location beautiful hotel loved it we stayed at the omni for 3 nights during a tour of california there were 2 adults and a 16yr old girl we found it with no problems and the valet service were wonderful with the car they were excellent all the time we were staying there the hotel itself if beautifully decorated and photos do not do it justice everything was easy to find and staff could not have been more helpful if they tried the room was wonderful if not a tad on the small side but great nonetheless mini bar and snacks well stocked we ate out in the restaurant downstairs one night which was pricy but well worth it the chef is actually from around where we live in england so it was a happy coincedence the food was amazing and service top notch a real first class la dining experience we left the 16yr old in the room while we ate in the restaurant and she would like to give her complements to the room service staff for the wonderful pizza and desert the restaurant is right by a whole little block of coffee shops and food places which is great for the mornings we found out way to malibu santa monica and hollywood no problem we drove to the first two but used public transport for the latter and it was very easy when explained to us by the hotel staff who were more than happy to help the pool was great there were a few teens and kids in it when we used it which was good and we had a great time swimming and laying by it on the comfortable loungers chatting to other guests we would stay here again  loved it ,positive,5,5,5,5
pricey but very nice we booked ten rooms for my staff for a thursday friday stay in early november due to a city wide convention and laker game downtown was virtually sold out we found concierge floor rooms for 259 the hotel is a few miles from the convention center but is directly across from the disney concert hall  some of the rooms have a great view of the hall the bellmen were very helpful and quick at this hotel we used car or cab servcie every day and one nice bellman made sure we knew the flat fee or expected rate so the cab couldn t overcharge us the lobby is small and centers around a strange glass atrium filled with a yellow iron sculpture resembling an animal the orchids filling the vases at every turn are nice the front desk is small but there was no line there was a mixup with my reservation at first but it was quickly fixed the clerk did not remember to inform me about the concierge lounge however my room was a good size with a great king bed lots of pillows a chair with ottoman and a desk the furnishing looked update and almost new and the bedding was very nice the tv was large but not a newer model there was an open plug available  not under the bed for electronics and a nice cd player alarm clock the robes were nice albeit huge there is a minibar with pricey but attractive items like chocolates nuts spa products even a cute little quote book and spray starch for your clothes  3 95  there is an iron and ironing board in the room which is nice although free pressing was included at the concierge level they needed about 24 hours to complete it i liked the bathroom which had a separate bath and shower and lovely toiletries the towels were plentiful and plush and there were two bath mats provided which was nice the marble vanity was a bit small for a woman s things but there were a few tiny glass shelves and a nice magnifying mirror  you must stand to reach it  lighting is good and there is a scale    in the bathroom water pressure was good and the bath shower temp was nice  i liked the bath salts that were provided  but the sink wouldn t run hot water at all there was also an interesting switch so you could listen to the tv in the bath without blasting it from the bedroom but it didn t work consistently enough to be of much use while it wasn t too hot or cold i would have like my ac to work just a bit better  even if you set it for 60 degrees it wouldn t go below 70 room service was prompt but extremely expensive  20 room service fee plus 2 50 delivery fee  as is the onsite restaurant  noe food was nicely done and hot on arrival with everything that i requested there is a bar lounge where you can order the room service menu but it really isn t much of a hotel restaurant and is hard to find on the third floor there are small couches and tables in the hallway near the lounge if you have a group there is a tiny tiny gift shop at the back of the third floor don t rely on this for much more than a soda snack or magazine but the prices were fair the concierge lounge is on the 17th floor and you must use your room card to access that floor the breakfast spread was much more than i expected  eggs sausage oatmeal pastries fruit and there is an internet alcove available for use the huge plasma screen tv was a nice touch one warning about the view from the hotel  there is an apartment building across the street and i noticed lots of tenants  men who stood on their balconies at night taking in the view of the hotel also the window jutts out from the building  nice almost like a balcony but if you look right or left you can see anyone standing in their window and they can see you i found the hotel comfortable and somewhat quiet i wouldn t hesitate to stay here again if i had business in the area but i think you can find more reasonably priced hotels if you just want to stay in downtown ,positive,4,5,3,4
less than expected after reading the great reviews of this hotel i decided to stay at here this weekend with my daughter for a shopping trip i booked the hotel via their website and used the 50 off coupon that was included with my select guest card package last year when i arrived at the hotel i was informed by the young desk clerk that i would not receive the parking  26 a night that was included in my 149 rate because i was using the discount then he stated i could not use the upgrade certificate with the discount either i then asked to speak with the manager instead he must have tried to confirm this himself as when he returned he told me that i could use the upgrade certificate    but from my experience this hotel doesn t really have upgraded rooms other than the club floor which he refused to put us in unless i paid an extra 35 a night i had already read on here of that upgrade being given for free and i declined upon opening the door of our room on the 14th floor i noticed we were given a good size room with a king size bed  when i had reserved 2 double beds non smoking then we were moved to another room on the same floor this time a standard double room i called downstairs and asked the manager why this room was considered an upgrade and she said it wasn t so she moved us one more time wait it get s better    on saturday after a trip to the fashion district we called the hotel for the town car to pick us up and only after 5 phone calls several promises that the driver was on his way   1 hour later he finally made it i don t know if i would ever depend on that service again anyway when we returned to our room it had a very strong odor of cigarette smoke apparently one of our neighbors decided to light up and the smoke entered our room through the vents my daughter called the front desk and they suggested that we move   again same thing occured here they moved us to a standard double instead of larger room and we have to move for the last time to the 6th floor that is 5 rooms total i have never had such an experience and hope to never have it again i stayed here because it looked like they excelled in service but i found the opposite to be true none of our preferences for the select guest program were fulfilled so i really am not sure why the program exists ,negative,0,0,1,1
friendly and comfortable stayed at the omni one night for business travel i found the hotel comfortable quiet and more than satisfactory for my needs following the advice of other trip advisor users i joined the omni s select guest program  free so i earned frequent flyer miles and got express check in several newspapers and a complimentary morning beverage the staff were friendly and efficient the room was large and comfortable every convenience one might expect as well as free wireless internet the king sized bed was piled with mountains of covers and was so inviting i fell asleep the minute my head hit the pillow  having arrived from the east coast   as a result i didn t even turn on the television but a card on the bedside table listed an array of local and cable stations available i didn t hear a noise all night i could see an outdoor lap pool from my window so that is available although obviously you could have an audience although there is not much of a street scape in downtown la i did take a walk the next morning and there are a few coffee shops around the disney concert hall is nearby and that is worth at least walking around if you have the time in sum it is a very friendly and comfortable hotel  a wonderful place to spend a night away from home ,positive,0,0,5,5
okay but not what i expected i read many reviews about the omni hotel los angeles and most had nothing but great things to say about this property perhaps my expectations were set too high because my experience did not mirror that which others encountered here are the issues i found hotel staff not at all knowledeable about the area around the hotel  e g  restaurants parking issues etc and they appeared minimally interested in helping me out the rooms were adequate but nothing spectacular as i had expected from other reviews the pool area had no spa and the towels were not kept stocked adequately during my stay one major issue i must make all aware of parking is a joke very expensive 26 00 a day  valet and if your into tipping everytime you have to get your car then well hats off to you  i m not into that and it was quite costly during my stay parking around the hotel is not recommended due to the reported car thefts and burglaries in the area by hotel staff i also didn t see any security on site at the hotel during my stay  at least they were not visible  overall the hotel is adequate but nothing remarkable and in my opinion this is not a 4 star property ,negative,2,0,1,3

great hotel  stayed here for 4 nights in early july found it a bit tricky to find as its located in downtown l a but used mapquest which helped we liked the location as it was handy for all the tourist attractions and at night it is very quiet  the standards at this hotel are very good  the staff are great they could not be more helpful and the valet parking staff greeted you with welcome back etc etc the beds were very comfortable with lovely linens and we had a nice view out of our window the reception area is very impressive we would return if we went back to l a ,positive,3,0,4,4
great value great service great location i had a previous stay at the san francisco omni and loved it so i thought it would be fun to try the omni in la we stayed at downtown la s omni to attend one of the free summer concerts in california plaza  nextdoor to the hotel and to visit moca  directly behind the hotel  we booked a package through the hotel s website that included a huge picnic dinner prepared for the concert valet parking and buffet breakfast for 2 my expectations were exceeded for several reasons as a select guest i was already checked into the hotel and only needed to pick up an envelope with my room keys and breakfast vouchers when i arrived  i signed up as a select guest on the omni s website before i booked the room after reading about it from another tripadvisor review thanks  our picnic dinner baskets were ready for us when we arrived in the roomwe had a large room on a high floor with a view of the walt disney concert hall and extra down pillows as i requested on their websitepicnic dinner basket was well stocked nicely presented and food was very tastythe gym facilities are well equipped and brand new nearly all of the cardio machines had their own tvsstaff were extremely helpful and attentivethere were many things to do in the vicinity of the hotel on a saturday night on this particular night was a concert presented by kcrw s sounds eclectico program featuring two world latin music groups the venue was incredibly packed since the show was free next door moca was presenting night vision  basically the museum is open until 1145pm and has a dj cocktail bar and art stationmostly appealing to young adults  the breakfast spread was really good and had a station with a short order cook preparing fresh omelets pancakes and french toast the only thing that might be bothersome to some people would be the noise generated by the concert and by moca this did not bother us at all but for those that need to get to bed early it would be a good idea to request a room on the opposite sides of the hotel that don t overlook either of these venues overall we had a wonderful time and are now even bigger fans of the omni chain we will definitely be back ,positive,5,5,4,4
fastastic bed the room was comfortable the bed was great it had huge pillows and comforters to die for it was voted the best bed we have slept on by my husband and me the only mishap that occured was on the final bill we booked an online special through the hotels website that included parking when we received the bill parking was charged again this was quickly remedied when we spoke to the front desk ,positive,0,0,5,5
perfect our family of 3 stayed at the omni on a friday and saturday night what a great week end deal we paid 159 00 a night with free valet parking and breakfast for two each morning  we didn t need 3 vouchers because i m not into breakfast  the guys selected breakfast items from a wonderful buffet the rooms were quiet and comfortable i loved the floral scent every time i entered the lobby the hotel is in walking distance to the disney concert hall our lady of the angels cathedral and the dorothy chandler pavilion the omni deserves the high trip advisor ranking it receives we highly recommend it for a week end visit ,positive,5,5,5,0
wonderful hotel all the reviews were spot on with this place an amazing bargain for a magnificent hotel the rooms were lovely and the beds supremely comfortable and with a large bathroom and separated shower and bath the gym had good sufficient equipment the staff were very helpful and welcoming and very patient we used the car valet service a little pricey at 26 per day but the car was got promptly on request and the hotel entrance smelt wonderful with all the lovely fresh orchids the hotel is in downtown la and is a 10 min walk from the nearest metro station pershing square though it s a sharp uphill to get back to the hotel from the metro the general area is fine a lot of homeless people near the metro and park and not a lot to do or eat in the area on a weekend as it s a business area and the hotel resturant is a little pricey but more than exceeded expectations ,positive,3,4,4,5
awesome hotel wonderful stay at the omni    the beds were wonderfully comfortable and the room in general was lovely nice hot water in shower  good water pressure the location was wonderful and it was easy to get anywhere from the omni the bar is very expensive even for l a we ordered a cheese plate and have never seen such small slivers of cheese and so few of them for the cost all in all though we d stay here again and would recommend it ,positive,4,3,3,4
great service excellent hotel i was looking forward to staying here after hearing such great reviews but it was even better than expected the hotel was beautiful and smelled of fresh flowers that were placed throughout the lobby staying on the club level is definitely worth it with beautiful views oversized rooms and an evening cocktail hour as well as morning breakfast the service was excellent as the hotel promptly responded to any request i had when i was craving a chicken sandwich at 1am but it wasn t on their night owl menu the chef said it would be no problem to make it i definitely recommend the omni ,positive,5,5,5,5

i m definitely going back we arrived at the omni at california plaza and were impressed it s a really nice looking hotel and the concierge quickly offered to bring our luggage up to our rooms for four women you know we didn t pack light excellent guest service check in was quick for halloween weekend our room was nice and clean the size was enough for two girls and all of our stuff the shower pressure was great comparable to a waterfall there is a built in speaker in the bathroom so that you can hear the television i slept well in the comfortable bed the cleaning ladies came while i was still asleep and did not stop knocking until i opened the door that was probably the only negative thing yes the room food is expensive so it s up to you there weren t any rowdy guests and that s always a plus our first day there we parked in a lot on the corner behind the hotel since it was cheaper but ended up walking for about 10 minutes dragging our luggage around downtown so i suggest using valet it s more convenient i would stay here again because it s a quiet area not far from shopping and nightlife and the guest service is excellent ,positive,4,0,4,5
mixed feelings stayed there over a long weekend  nov 1013 was attending a convention at the convention center which is in an absolutely dismal part of downtown there are only terrible hotels within walking distance  hotel figueroa holiday inn the omni is roughly a mile and a quarter away but not a bad walk it really tries to be a first class hotel in terms of services but it fallsa bit short example we asked the concierge about local restaurants they reccommmended in alvarado by the train station in a touristy area ok  the food was terrible and it was a rip off but thats not why i was pissed they provided us with a free town car ride to the place but when we called back they told us it would be at least 45 minutes to pick us up i would still of not been mad  except it is very difficult to find cabs in la we had to walk over to the train station and only out of providence was there one there they did apologize and reimbursed us for the cab i guess my beef is that they should of warned us they might not be able to pick us up instead of putting us in a dangerous situation and i would of gone to a more touristy area  chinatown where they have more cabs otherwise the hotel was fine i guess my real beef is with la its just not tourist friendly at all its too spread out and you definitely need a car  ,negative,1,1,1,1
eat before you go i was expecting better given that this is a top chain but was disappointed the room was small as was the bathroom the hotel restaurant served typical la cuisine which means if you re a redblooded meat and potatoes type you ll go hungry on the plus side the pressure in the shower was awesome and the room service breakfast was good the hotel valet staff was very helpful as i needed to navigate downtown to get a few things i had left at home however they let mark garagos the attorney who respresented the evil scott peterson park his car there as his office is next door seeing him unexpectedly was a little like running into hitler or satan okay maybe that s a bit dramatic  but it was unsettling all in all this omni wasn t the great hotel i thought it was going to be ,negative,1,1,1,1
luxury hotel practical rather than hip stayed here while attending a conference at l a convention center i knew i made the right choice as i stepped into a spacious corner room late at night after a long day of work and flying everything looked and smelled new clean and fresh the decor and furniture were modern but still traditional at the same time the bed was very comfortable i did not have any trouble getting to sleep nor did i wake up with a sore back air conditioning was great unlike a previous reviewer my bathroom did not have separate tub and shower stall but it was still very spacious and wellappointed i did not hear any noise from outside or from other rooms which is exceptional nowadays the front desk staff i dealt with were professional yet downtoearth  not to mention very efficient  the housekeeper left me a thankyou note for the tip i left her one morning the towncar driver and bell staff were courteous and helpful i did not have any meals or drinks at the hotel  which i regret  so i can t speak for the food or restaurant bar service i did have some minor issuesi experienced low signal strength and could not connect to the free wifi internet access i did not have a chance to ask for assistance on this matter but i trust they would have tried to help out if i did also there was a problem with authorizing my corporate credit card but that was quickly solved  somehow their magstrip reader picked up the expiration date incorrectly  the hotel s image is not hip or edgy but that s ok because i was a tired business traveler that didn t want or need to contend with a staff of trendy stuckup actor actress wannabees if you want to stay where the stars and other assorted l a scenesters party look in the west hollywood area or possibly beverly hills all in all i thought it was a good value for the price paid and a better choice than the big convention hotels in downtown l a  which were actually more expensive despite being a bit further from the convention center ,positive,5,0,4,4
would recommend this hotel to all my friends stayed in this hotel for 15 days between 13th till 28th and was really happy with this hotel had no complaints about it at all the staff were really friendly especially the guys working out in front door and the person working at the front desk was extremely helpful when we had problems trying to locate a retail park the lady at the desk not only got us all the details but she printed out the best possible way to getting their rooms were big and comfortable definetly would recommend this hotel to anyone visint in los angeles if i ever go back to la i definetly stay here again ,positive,0,0,4,5
don t drink the water    room was clean and comfortable however the lack of amenities was disappointing the pool area was a mess and the gym was being renovated for the price they could have thrown in a complimentary breakfast as many other hotels inns do watch out for the overpriced snacks and water in the room water was 4 75 per bottle plus 15 restocking fee plus tax the doormen were the only staff who were helpful once we signed in the desk staff couldn t have cared less parking alert if you are staying a weekend you will save lots of money by parking in the public garage next door  where museum attendees park  8 80 per day compared to 24 at the omni ,negative,0,2,3,2
loved it very convienent downtown location staff was very helpful and very friendly beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and the rooms and bathroom were very spacious valet parking was a bit spendy but all of downtown la parking is that way the only thing that would of made it excellent for us would of been a whirlpool jacuzzi otherwise we were very happy with our stay ,positive,5,0,4,5
very nice weekend downtown hotel this is probably the 4th or 5th time we have stayed at the downtown omni hotel on south olive in los angeles we stay there after driving over from phoenix to attend the la opera and can easily walk to dorothy chandler music center also the weekend rates are reasonable about 109 00 before taxes via a website registration however there a a 24 00 per night parking charge for guests the rooms we have had were all large and very pleasant often with good views the bathrooms have separate tubs and showers and excellent toiletries the closets are spacious and have plenty of hangers in short this is a true 4 star hotel and our only problem was that we requested a king size bed and received two queens on this stay the lobby entrance is off olive street on the first floor the two restaurants one the high end dinner spot noe and the other a full service cafe are on the third floor which leads out to grand avenue directly adjacent to the museum of contemporary art this occurs because the hotel is on top of bunker hill so olive street is below grand avenue at this point there are a number of downtown restaurants but usually they are not busy on weekend nights we often have breakfast at a deligtfully funky  and very inexpensive spot about a mile and a half away on figueroa and 9th street the hotel is fairly quiet on weekends except for the occasional wedding or high school prom but i imagine would be a lot more active during the week since it is in the heart of the los angeles high rise business district we recommend this hotel ,positive,5,4,5,4
comfortable safe bet stayed at the omni in january 2005  excellent spacious and clean rooms service standards throughout were excellent  possibly too much attentionat breakfast   parking expensive  though efficient location is fine if youhave a car the area is deserted after 6 30pm  would not be safe to walkaround easy access to major freeways a good downtown base  probably better base for business than leisure i would use it again  ,positive,4,0,4,5
poor service i went to the omni after i read all of the great reviews posted on this site personally the hotel was nice but i thought the service was very poor and rude the restaurant  bar was nice but again the service was terrible we waited for 20 mins to get service  and that is only because we went to the bar 3 times to remind them we were waiting each time they kept saying someone was coming   we finally left and ordered room service service is everything to me   i will not be going back to the omni next time i m in los angeles ,negative,0,0,0,1

loved the omni stayed her for 3 nights on the 15th october 04 after travelling round all of california nevada and arizona could not fault the hotel at all the valet parking was a little on the high price but if you ask nicley and flutter your eye lashes they may reduce this for you maybwe we were just lucky the room was amazing and the bathroom was lovely espically to have a separate bath and shower room service was quick and the bar staff were lovely loved it here and looking again to return ,positive,0,0,4,5
quiet at weekends i stayed here for 5 nights and some of the over a weekend in september  the hotel was lovely but the  mini bar was v expensive  and we arrived late and there was no where open to eat at all  around the hotel at weekends there is nothing open but there is a metro station nearby and for 3 you have a day pass and can visit most touristy places  i would recommend this hotel but definately do your homework before you stay   ,positive,4,0,3,0
disappointing hotel great location travelling on business i was booked at the omni the hotel itself is rather disappointing the carpeting is elderly and stained the bathroom not userfriendly separate shower which is fine but no places in the shower to put anything but soap the public spaces are nice and the restaurant was quite good if noisy but the rooms and the small concretesurrounded pool were a disappointment location near disney hall and dorothy chandler great but if you are walking back to the hotel from a performance at night you can t get back in the grand ave door after 10pm which means you re walking around looking for an entrance in the dark with noone else around a little disturbing la isn t ny with an active street life and the area is really dead at 11 pm ,negative,3,0,1,1

beautiful hotel lousy service when we first arrive we were greeted by the valet people they took the car as we went in after getting our hotel room we decided to go out on the town however when we went to get our car they informed us that we have been charged  24 we weren t told of the charges before hand so this had came as a surprise to us where we are from it is unheard of to have parking fees that high we were then told that we where going to be charged 24 for every day that we were there and that we couldn t park anywhere else not wanting to spend an extra 100 dollars just on parking we decided to park at a near by parking lot and walk when we asked to have the charges removed from our bill because we no longer needed the valet parking they rudly ask us many questions and after waiting 15 minutes they finally took off all charges along with taking off the charges they also closed our account so we could no longer buy items  like a prepay movie  we had also asked for directions to a place but somehow they guided us the wrong way we ended up in a mass confuesion trying to find our way to our destination the hotel is also by a very low part of town from many window views one could see homeless people laying about however the hotel is very beautifully decorated and the rest of the staff was happy to accomidate us  i will be staying at a different hotel in a different side of the town hopefully this review is helpfull to anyone that is considering staying at the biltmore ,negative,1,0,1,1
not a pleasant experience i would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy this hotel is the thing that nightmares are made of the location is terrible  it is located in a dangerous part of town and incredibly hard to find the beauty of the hotel itself ends in the lobby  the rooms are small and not clean the staff is rude and unbearable and the hotel itself has a bad smell to it instead of treating their guests as paying customers and in a friendly and helpful way  the employees at this hotel treat their guests as though they should not have any requests or questions and should stay out of their way the staff is pretentious and does not make their guests feel welcome this hotel is not worth the price i will never return to this hotel ,negative,1,0,1,1
things not always better the second time around my husband and i stayed at this hotel in 2001 and had such a wonderful time we promised ourselves we would go back well we wish we hadn t kept our promise when we arrived the front desk peronnel wasn t as friendly as the last time in fact they weren t helpful at all it was the bellhop who was sooooooooo nice without asking he told us everything about la and what we could do and where we could go he also told us about the hotel amenities he was very informative we stayed on the 10th floor which is the club level we were told at check in that the rooms had been renovated and we would be very happy with ours oh my if our room had been renovated i would hate to see the rest the 10th floor smelled old and musty our room and bathroom were dirty the walls looked patched up and the shower head was disgusting and looked like it hadn t been cleaned since it was first installed when i sat on the bed it felt hard as a rock so i called down to housekeeping to ask for a bed pad the lady told me she didn t think they had pads and i should call the front desk and ask to be moved since most of the mattresses had been replaced in the last year but our mattress was one of the ones that hadn t so i called down to front desk who said they would check on it for me when front desk called back she rudely informed me the mattresses on our floor hadn t been replaced and there was nothing she could do she said she would send housekeeping up to put a pad on the bed they did but i had to jump thru hoops to get it because we stayed on the club level we had evening snacks and continental breakfast wow   that was definitely worth the upgrade the breakfast was delicious and plentiful with fresh pastries scrambled eggs bacon sausage fresh oj and the freshest sweetest mix of berries i ve ever eaten we ate at sai sai the onsite japanese restaurant we had eaten there before and had a wonderful experience not so this time the waitress handed us our menus and returned about 3 minutes later  no exaggeration and asked us if we had made up our minds when we told her we needed more time she became irritated she hovered over us  without being helpful the whole time and we felt like we shouldn t be there it was very uncomfortable and then our food arrived cold the 10th floor concierge was definitely much more helpful and friendly than the lobby staff the gentleman manning the concierge desk spent a considerable amount of time showing us maps of la and telling us where to go and where to eat we followed most of his suggestions and weren t disappointed check out was a different story the valet staff must have been in a bad mood because they were rude to everyone people were complaining to management and staff it was sad i m not sure what happened at this hotel in the last few years but our stay at the biltmore was a big disappointment for us and we won t be back i ve stayed at some old hotels that have updated their facilities without losing their historical charm unfortunately the biltmore isn t one of those places i also hope the front desk and valet staff remembers that they represent the hotel and should seek some friendly advice from the bellhops ,negative,3,1,1,1
horrible service we stayed at the hotel for a wedding prior to our arrival i called and confirmed our reservation for a nonsmoking king size bed when we got to the hotel they stated they only had two nonsmoking rooms  queen size and double size beds so we opted for the nonsmoking queen size bed the room was small old smelley dusty and the lights were not working our request for the second room was met with rude commentary and poor service the second was much better than the first room but more inline with a one or two star hotel it was not a fourstar hotel other guests that were attending the wedding also stayed at the hotel and had similar experiences we were all very disappointed with the cleanliness of the rooms service at the front desk and valet we would not stay there again ,negative,0,0,0,1
rooms in need of renovation yes the lobby and other public areas are beautiful the rooms however are average at best and not nearly the standard that i would expect from an otherwise classy hotel i don t mind that the place is old and found no problems with plumbing elevators etc but there was that old smell everywhere and the beds were terribly uncomfortable  lumpy mattresses on both of the double beds linens were worn out poly cotton blend i ve had better sheets at the most budget hotels we had a decent view of pershing square through four windows that opened our room had no mini fridge which was a disappointment front desk staff were rather standoffish but the bellhops were great breakfast in the coffee shop was nice but the 18 buffet seemed overpriced the fruit plate for about 6 was a much better deal parking is expensive and valet service was very slow ,negative,0,1,1,1
never again my stay here was for 4 nights 48 january  05 i was staying with family and i have to say it was one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever had upon check in the reception staff was rude and very distant when i noted that i had requested a high floor room i was told that i would be on the 4th floor and that was that once in our room which to give it credit was a decent size we realised that the closet was tiny and the room smelled old i understand that this is an historic hotel but not having the ability to open windows and allow fresh air in is ridiculous on the first time using the shower i opened the shower curtain to find the bathroom had flooded i called down to report it to the main desk they sent an engineer who had no idea what i was talking about not sure what was done to stop the problem it looked liked they regrouted the bath but the bathroom flooded again everytime it was used in the end it seemed as though the double layer shower curtain was leaking there was a fridge in our room which we didn t have to pay for good thing too considering when i went to use it i found old food from the previous guests inside who knows how long it had been there i know they have housekeeping but somehow they seemed to have forgotten our room only when i dropped a piece of clothing on the floor i found it covered in dust that was when i realised that they only vacuumed the areas on show continuing with the service received in this hotel upon check out they did not disappoint i was ignored for around 10 minutes until i approached the desk and announced my wish to leave the lack of attention and eye contact from staff made my exit from this hotel something that could not have come too soon ,negative,0,0,1,1
make sure they don t shut the water off when you re about to check out   we stayed here in november 2003 and have been meaning to write this review since then we were really looking forward to staying in this hotel after reading about its history and the location what a disappointment you re lulled into a false sense of security with the oppulent lobby but once you re passed that it goes downhill very quickly our room was tiny with a tiny bathroom and a tiny tv a safe that didn t work and we had to get the security chap to look at it our room looked out onto a courtyard which from the sound of it had every dumpster in greater los angeles being emptied all night the valet parking was the slowest we have ever come across and none of the staff we met were particularly helpful or motivated the final straw was being told on our last day that the hotel was turning off all the water from 10 00 a m until 3 00 p m it would have been nice to be able to shower before a twelve hour flight home but that wasn t to be we have no plans to stay at this hotel again we d rather spend our money on a hotel more deserving that knows how to treat their guests ,negative,3,0,2,1
don t waste your money i would not recommend this hotel to anyone the pictures on the website were very disceiving i felt sick to my stomach when we arrived to the hotel itself when we fianally got to our room  via stairs i wanted to immediatly go elsewhere it was horrible inside we spent as much time as possible away from the place it was in a bad location and the people working the desk well that was a whole different matter if you are afraid of filthy places do not stay there       ,negative,1,0,0,2
our clothes were stolen we stayed in the hotel royal and got a room in the attic  very oddly designed and quite a walk up one day we got stuck in a typical new orleans downpour and we left our clothes to dry in the bathroom when we got back to our room not only were those clothes missing  but other accessories had been taken from the bathroom  a belt tie bath products and the front desk staff didn t do a thing about it i would never stay here ever again ,negative,0,0,0,1
awful just awful lemme tell ya  i want to know who their photographer is because i m sure he can make me look like marilyn monroe talk about making a dog look good   the rooms are nothing like what s pictured on the website there was a hole in the ceiling above the bed with crumbled plaster on the bedspread the jacuzzi suite was a jetted tub not the jacuzzi described furniture was not contemporary chic as it appears in the photos  it was just cheap and tacky cigarette butts and other trash were in the fountain in the weedy courtyard desk clerk was eating her lunch when we came in she never paused except to take a personal cell call she never paused either long enough to answer questions but continued as if we were an afterthought we canceled our stay and walked up the street to another hotel ,negative,0,0,0,1
do not stay at the hotel royal a group of stayed at this hotel for a family get together and it was an awful place the front desk individuals are for the most part unprofessional and unhelpful the rooms are filthy   unsanitary to say the least the towels were always stained dirty and they the sheets did not fit on the bed there were no bathroom toiletries  except for soap available and the water never got hot in the shower the balcony suites consisted of a window going out to a balcony that was about to fall off the side of the building   what a sham we were never able to sleep in past 7 am because of the noise on the street and coming from other rooms this was a huge disappointment you do not feel safe at the hotel and arrive home unrested and wanting to sanitize everything in your suitcase try somewhere else   you will be very unhappy here no matter what your standards are ,negative,0,0,0,2
this place is a total ripoff i cancelled my reservation to this hotel on october 1st and asked for my deposit back they told me i would have to talk to the manager susan smith because she s the only one who handles refunds that in itself seemed odd to me anyway i called her office almost every day since the 1st but she was never there i left countless messages with my phone number but she never called me back it s been over two weeks now and i ve spent lots of money on long distance calls but the hotel still owes me 223 74 deposit on two rooms i threatened to complain to the better business bureau but it did no good i guess they don t care about customer service i m just really glad i didn t actually stay at this hotel what horrible service   never stay at a hotel that requires a deposit on the room as you may never get it back if you cancel ,negative,0,0,1,1
shared similar experience with  junior suite as an earlier post stated i too was upgraded to the junior suite believe me there ain t nothing sweet about it my problems began in room 4 in the rear building the walls were filthy handprints smudges and god knows what else the windows were flush with the ceiling so no chance of seeing out the blinds were ready to fall out of one window the headboard had an inch of dirt on top the walls of the bathroom were covered in dust no closet space to speakof other than a homemade armoire 3x3x3 then the upgrade 6 flights of stairs from ground level   carpet on the last two flights was covered in dust than no one bothered to vacum an earlier post gave an accurate description of the room and its condition the continental breakfast were pastries straight out of wal mart packages the same stale pastries for 4 days why they don t have an arrangemnt with the pastierre around the corner is beyond me the front desk folks tried the best they could to make it a better stay but to no avail peter  the day clerk was the most helpful understanding person i have encountered yet if you do book a room ask for a courtyard room the showers are smaller than most broom closets but the rooms are great ,negative,0,0,0,2

acceptable the sofitel is probably hit or miss and for me it was a miss the hotel looks nice and it is furnished in a way you would expect from a 4star place the service was very friendly and we had a decent time overall however we had a few problemseach minor but collectively annoyingduring our stay1 we arrived to find stains on our sheets and no soap in the bathroom and because we had arrived late we had to change the sheets ourselves 2 the walls between us and our neighbors were surprisingly thin at one point we could hear the local newscast on the tv next door as if it were showing in our room 3 this was the kickerit happened to rain on our last night there and all the water off the roof drained right onto a metal windowsill outside our window needless to say we slept very poorly even after housekeeping gave us some earplugs if it rains do not stay on the 4th floor interestingly when i complained to the front desk she said many of the guests had made similar complaints and that the hotel management was pushing for a renovation i won t be staying again until they do ,negative,0,0,0,2
needs work this is the third sofitel property my husband and i stayed at the other two were in europe we were fairly happy with the previous bookings and so we decided to try sofitel los angeles details were awry at this hotelath mirror placed too far to be useful dust on the furniture a toilet that splashed when flushed one robe provided instead of two knocking on the door and waking us early in the morning to deliver the newspaper instead of just leaving it so we may sleep undisturbed with the exception of the person who woke us up with the newspaper the staff was generally nice and helpfulhough more training would not hurt we probably would not recommend this sofitel property ,negative,0,0,0,2
great affordable location we chose to stay here on the advise of a friend that said the location was central to sites and studios in the area and the hotel was a good value they were right on all counts and the staff could not have been nicer and more helpful in getting us directions and dinner reservations the rooms were in very good shape and the property appears to have been recently remodeled the pool area was nice and sunny in the afternoon which was nice after a day out walking rodeo drive which is about a mile away for the location price and service we will definetly stay here again ,positive,4,0,4,4
the jewel in the crowne we won this holiday on the radio when we arrived at lax we were met by a shuttle service approx transfer time was 1 hour due to traffic and other drop off s check in was very straight forward they asked us if we would like to leave a credit card imprint or not there was no pressure to do so the room was a decent size with 2 queen sized beds and a large bright bathroom with shower and bath the room also had a cd player and a large television and coffee maker the ice machine was just down the hallway the location of the hotel was a little out of the way and without a car it would have been a struggle getting about i can highly recommend the car hire company under the hotels parking lot breakfast was excellent and plentiful overall for location and facilities this hotel was a little overpriced but what the heck it cost us nothing  i would stay here again as it made an ideal base for a fantastic holiday and will be in our memories forever ,positive,2,5,2,3
good surprise we recently stayed at this hotel because we needed to be in beverly hills for 2 nights and the four seasons was sold out well that turned out to be a good thing for us i will no longer jump to spend over 500 night to stay at this four seasons there s nothing wrong with the crowne plaza at one third the price you get a comfortable bed spectravision good housekeeping a very decent room and a great location and it doesn t cost a fortune note if you need quiet which we do make sure to book the top floor it s the designated quiet floor we were fine up there no it doesn t compare to a 5 star hotel but neither does it s price for what it is it s above average don t be afraid to use it ,positive,4,0,4,3
a lovely hotel despite a slight hitch when checking in i had a very pleasant experience in this hotel the reception area has a nice upmarket feel to it and the reception staff were very helpful complimentary citrus water was provided as was free internet access the room itself was clean very comfortable and quite good value for money i would definitely recommend this hotel ,positive,0,0,4,4
stay away at all cost we stayed there 3 days out of a weeks stay in the area nice hotel small rooms but the noise from people working in the hall ways was horrible not 8 to 5 during the day but 23 in the am they have all mexican workers doing the work who not only work all hours of the day and night but they also sleep in the hall ways and the linen closets i called several times to speak to the hotel manager and was told but the front desk that he was looking into it but never seen anyone take any action people where so pissed over the noise they where checking out 4 am as i did at 5 am on the third day of our stay because of the fighting in the hallways in the middle of the night the mother company of crown plaza gave us 500 for our trouble and picked up our other hotels tab the hotel itself is run 100 by mexicans and they harbor people not only in the stairways but the parking garage for cheap labor on the hotels refurbishing stay away at all cost          ,negative,0,0,0,1
got an upgrade we arrived at this hotel in the small hours of the morning and were given a room on the 4th floor when we tried to get into the room the lock was on the door so my husband went down to reception to find out what was going on we were told that sometimes the locks do catch but that we would be given an upgrade to an executive room on the 12th floor room was large and had a king size bed bathroom not very big but adequate with plenty of towels hairdrier and cosmetics on the bed was a gauze bag with earplugs sleep mask and lavender linen spray we had breakfast in the dining room and both the buffet and the ala carte menu were good large servings and well cooked and presented the staff were very attentive and friendly also ate dinner there one night and thoroughly enjoyed it reception staff were very helpful when i needed to find a book shop even providing me with a map so i knew exactly where i was and how far the book shop would be i would recommend this hotel ,positive,0,4,0,4
awful this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in however it holds the hotel of the year award for 2001 for the chain but hey do not appear to have any clean bed sheets i found black hair and big yellow puddle stains on the sheets mattresses and comforters i requested to move rooms and the new room had the same problems housekeeping came and tried to clean the bed but had to open new sheets because the replacement sheets also had stains this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in based upon the quality of the bedroom what a disgusting hotel i checked out the same day ,negative,0,0,0,1
great hotel but room was a bit small my wife and i had overlapping business trips to la so i joined her a few days early she was booked  the crowne plaza in beverly hills  i stayed 2 nights with her the first thing we noticed was that the staff was extremely nice  helpful according to my wife there was problem w the original room  i never saw it as i was unloading the car  but we were immediately switched to another room  on the 11th floor   unbelievable view  the room was a little small  especially the bathroom   just big enough to shut the door  turn around in  but adequate the room had all the expected amenities  a microfridge the bed  pillows were extremely comfortable the bar lounge seemed nice but the restaurant was average at best overall a very nice place ,positive,4,3,0,4
not rodeo drive but excellent stay this is a good hotel located a few blocks from rodeo drive  20 min walking with lots of facilities the room was very comfortable bed was great lots of pillows to choose spacious bathroom was good though a little bit old for la you have to have a car so the hotel is quite nice located the beverly drive has some shops and a lot of restaurants which are worth looking at you can walk to rodeo drive and take a cab back better than trying to find a parking place hotel has a garage about 16 dollar day free internet restaurant was ok but very dark and old we did not have breakfast there but they brew starbucks coffee there there is a supermermarket around the corner where coffee and fresh pastries bagels etc are available so best option for breakfast ,positive,3,3,0,4
liked the hotel but reception staff were a bit dizzy recently stayed at the crowne plaza for 4 nights with husband and 8 month old baby we were part of a large group and had 7 rooms booked at the hotel we arrived and booked in but this took a while as the receptionist didn t really know what she was doing eventually we got checked in and went to our rooms reception also misadvised 2 of our party and said they were only booked in for 3 days instead of 4 which was incorrect but did cause us to worry the room was clean and tidy and had a large very comfortable bed the rooms were quiet and dark and we had a good view  we were on the 9th floor the room also had tea coffee facilities which was great for us to warm bottles baby food breakfast was buffet style or you could order off the menu the food was tasty and they had a good selection also they were accomodating for babies and had high chairs available hotel is well placed in beverly hills and was just a short walk to supermarket bars and restaurants and is close to rodeo drive felt safe walking round in the evening spoke to the concierge to book a trip to see stars homes etc  and we got a really good deal as there were 13 adults and 2 infants we were able to hire our own mini bus to take us to all the major sights and we could stop when we wanted to take photos we also booked the minibus to take us to and from universal studios and to the aurport which worked out much cheaper than using standard taxis would stay at this hotel again as it is very clean and comfortable and in a great location they just need to train their reception staff a bit better ,positive,4,4,4,4
not what you expect stayed at the crowne for 6 nights just because it is in beverly hills does not mean it is top of the line the rooms were very small the bathroom was rediculously small  take one step in turn around and sit on toilet step in shower or wash hands prison cells are bigger than this  staff was very pleasant and helpful bartender not very friendly plenty of sitting space in lounge and check in area we stayed on the 8th floor which included a small refrigerator  nice admenity  ,negative,3,0,0,2
very pleasant hotel the hotel is conveniently located the rooms are big with all what you need for a confortable stay including this dream box for relax that crowne plaza has on all their rooms conveniently located minutes ago from teathers shopping malls and all the action you might look for in beverly hills staff is friendly and they have a nice self parking lot i really have very good memories of this hotel that will be a good option for my next trip to beverly hills  ,positive,4,0,0,4
don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,negative,4,0,1,1
abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,negative,0,0,0,1
it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,negative,0,3,2,0
outstanding a very pleasant surprise we stayed here for two nights and were upgraded to a one bedroom suite the customer service was second to none our room was very large plenty of room for 2 adults and two teenagers had a small kitchen area nice granite countertop breakfast bar large walk in closet felt like home great view from the 12th floor and we enjoyed the priority club lounge that featured a free continental breakfast and evening appetizers good location rodeo drive shopping and dining is just four blocks away i enjoyed an early morning run through the beverly hills neighborhoods also only 20 minute away from universal studios and other hollywood entertainment sites clean and very comfortable accommodations nice pool and spa i would definitely stay here again  ,positive,4,4,0,4
a comfortable stay i was here for two nights in june my second stay at the crowne plaza i found it to be very comfortable both stays and since i often have business nearby will undoubtably stay again check in went well and the desk staff was very helpful my rooms both times were as requested and were large with nice views lots of light very comfortable beds a lounger and an ottoman and wellapppointed bathrooms wireless that worked well quiet     no complaints though i agree with those that say that the breakfast is soso here however it is walking distance from several other restaurants the location is quite convienent for west side activities a good value for what you get and for beverly hills recommended ,positive,4,3,4,4

good value hotel reviewer stone ukstayed at the hotel for 2 nights early october no real issues with the hotel it s one of those that does what it says on the lable  provides you with clean and comfortable room close to the amenities would i stay there again yes without a thought if all i was looking for was a central base to take in the sights no issues with the staff who are both very helpful and knowledgable ,positive,3,0,0,4
very nice overall my wife and i visited la for the first time this past june and the crown plaza turned out to be a good choice located on the fringes of beverly hills the neighborhood was clean and safe most of our sightseeing was confined to west la and the beaches so the location was convenient the hotel itself is generally well kept and the staff without exception was very friendly and accommodating the complimentary continental breakfast  for priority club members a free service  was a good alternative for those mornings when we wanted to grab something and go we d certainly stay here again the clarks cape coral fl ,positive,4,4,0,4

expected more i stayed at this hotel for three nights based on reviews from tripadvisor after arriving on a 13 hour flight we just wanted to check in and sleep we were told our room would be ready in half an hour and they would let us know when it was ready we waited patiently in the foyer    two hours later i asked what was happening and was told oh sorry i forget to let you know  your room was ready over an hour ago exhausted and frustrated we finally made it to bed the room was nice  spacious and clean but the walls were paper thin and we were kept awake at 1am with television and converstation in the next room we could hear word for word what they were saying i am a priority club member and was given the free breakfast which was very good on the last day the concierge arranged for a town car to take us to the airport five minutes after booking he called our room to confirm that it was indeed booked when the town car never showed up we asked the bellman about it who asked somebody else who said oh yeah    he cancelled five minutes later we were told that it was never booked at all we were left to find our own way to the aiport the location is in the middle of nowhere i would not stay here again ,negative,0,4,0,2
comfortable and friendly we stayed april 20  22 and thought it was a very comfortable room with terrific bed and pillows however the bathroom was sufficient but small the staff were very helpful and friendly  especially when my husband became ill one night and they were of great assistance and concerned for his well being room service tray very well presented especially with fresh flowers and mints the hotel was also in a good neighbourhood would stay again ,positive,4,0,0,4
lovely we stayed here at the end of april 06 and had no problems clean service was good  breakfast good  you are entitled to it only if you register online as a priority club member before making reservation  which is free  staff friendly and helpful while the hotel is further out everything else is also spread out so no hotel is central unless you want to pay 300 u s  night in hollywood would recommend renting a car no matter where you stayed as this would eliminate expensive taxis would stay here again ,positive,3,4,3,4
excellent hotel  great location stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our 15 night stay in the usa booked the hotel through the holiday inn website  as a priority club member  which is free to join  was very surprised at the rate quoted  only 99  tax we booked a 2 x queen bed room  non smoking upon arrival at the hotel  following the excellent driving instructions from the website we were checked in prompty and very effeciently and directed to our rooms as a priority club member tey have special floors in certain hotels  we arrived at our rooms and were very very impressed wth what greated us high floor view of la with the hollywood sign in the distance 2 queen beds with feather duvet feather topper and great pillows air conditioning that worked and welcome letters from the general manager and priority club manager crowne plaza also have recently introduced a sleep programe  so on the bed was a cd for helping you to drift off into a deep sleep some lavender pillow mist ear plugs and an eye mask all very nice little touches used the hotels valet parking at 18 50 per night  to be honest it is more cost efficeint to use the hotels self parking at only 14 00 per night  as it is under the hotel and you dont have to keep tipping the concierge everytime you need your car keys as a priority club member this also entitles you to a free continental breakfast which includes juices tea coffee yoghurt cereals bagels muffins you can also upgrade for 5 to the buffet breakfast which we did on one morning and had a cooked breakfast all in all i would definetly stay at this hotel again  its location is excellent being on the outskirts of beverly hills and only 2 or 3 blocks from rodeo drive  we felt safe and walked down to a couple of restaurants in the evenings join the priority club to get the comp b fast and the priority floor  ,positive,4,4,3,4
this hotel is run down we stayed 2 nights on vacation trip the hotel has been elegant but is terribly run down stains on the carpet breakfast trays which were not removed for days stains on the elevator mirror not removed for days we asked for a quiet room and got a free upgrade to the quite zone in on of the top floors advertized with no slamming doors no loud tv s etc   the room was o k but a very small bathroom having the door right to the beds  no privacy after midnight the guy next to us started a discussion with his wife partner so we coud head every word walls like paper fortunately he stopped after 20 minutes it is a pity this nice hotle is run down that bad it could be much better having proper management it does not compare to other crowne plaza s we know  vienna rome hamburg ,negative,0,0,0,2
great location stayed here for 5 nights showed my priority club card upon checkin as advised by other tripadvisor members received free breakfast for 2 during the stay they first gave me a room next to the coke and ice machines on the 9th flour not good if you value your sleep but upon request on the front desk immediately got a different room on the 8th floor and slept perfectly good central location if you want to visit the santa monica area or the hollywood area save neighbourhood good restaurants nearby if you do not want to walk to rodeo or beverly hills restaurant shopping areas take the bus only 3 for a day pass and in this area there are no  strange people on the bus yet bus stop is in front of the hotel  bus 14  some minor cleaning issues in the room  there is indeed a pile of dust on the ventilation in the badroom and i found some hairs of previous guests on the badroom wall but overall cleaning is good and the hotel has new carpets beds and room furniture  or at least it looks new and friendly staff would recommend it and stay again ,positive,4,3,4,4
budget hotel  deceived by tripadvisor ratings this hotel was run down the service was mediocre the beds were advertised as new comfortable beds they were not   we could not sleep on our squeeky sloping beds most of the dishes at the continental breakfast were dirty elevator area was very dirty the walls were soiled concierge is available during day bellmen take over in the evening bellman could not provide any information even approximate time distance info to ronald reagan library 40 minutes away eye level wall vent in bathroom had an inch of accumulated dust dirt debris in it i would not return to this hotel ,negative,2,0,3,2
a but shabby and not chic we stayed here for one night in december and i would have to say i would not stay here again we did get a good rate from lastminute so for the price i can t complain too much the lobby is nice enough but the wallpaper in the hallways is peeling there were dishes and plates all along the floor in the hallway the rooms were okay nothing special the hotel is located in an area that s off the beaten path there are restaurants in the hotel and down the road but i just didn t feel comfortable walking there at night with just my young son the staff was all nice enough no problem there we stayed at loews beverly hills around the corner a few weeks before and it was more expensive but much nicer ,negative,2,0,3,3
somewhere between very good  this is the second time i ve been here on business i like the fact that they have free wifi internet and what everyone has said about the staff i double that extremely courteous i only had occasion to eat one meal  room service and it was excellent i was on the club level the room was fine in terms of size the connecting door is a disadvantage ie the tour of italians returned at two in the morning hammered and sat next door and laughed for an hour very loud for me the location was great my client is right up pico about five minutes i d recommend this for people who have never been to so cal and are here on tourism of which there seem to be quite a few here ,positive,4,5,0,4
totally disappointed i ve booked a room because of its name  crowne plaza but what i found was a terrible hotel the room was dirty and smelly i asked in the front desk for another room but they did not have one at that moment on my 3rd day the bathtub starts to flood i asked again for another room and what i got was another dirty and smelly room stained towels smelly pillows used bandaid in the floor   on the check out i have filled the guest survey but never had an answer for my complains   so   i would not stay here if someone paid me to ,negative,0,0,0,1
great location nice hotel we stayed at the crowne plaza from august 27 to 31 location was great just 15 minutes walk from rodeo drive and 510 minutes to nice bards and restaurants not at all a bad location as a person mentioned we requested a room on high floor with nice view and got a room on 10 floor great view to downtown other side of the hotel  pool side would give view to beverly hills homes but we loved downtown side make sure you get a room on high floow otherwise you have vierw to next building only thing we missed is an inroom safe thius should be standard beds are great you also get a relaxation cd you can use in the rooms cd player and a nice linen spray bathrooms are averaged they need some modernization service was good staff always very helpful if you are priority club member  free membership make sure you sign in before you arrive you get free continental breakfast in lobby selection is limited but ok tried buffet breakfast once also fair price but if you have breakfast in the area its better there is a supermarket next block you can also get everything there pool area is nice during weekend they sometimes run out of towels and deckchairs during weekdays its ok if we go to los angeles again we devinitively will stay there again ,positive,4,4,4,4

amazing service what a pleasant surprise to obtain a wonderful rate in beverly hills but most importantly discovering a staff who just couldn t do enough for you the front desk the maids wait staff concierge etc  all went out of their way to accomodate any of our needs or requests this type of attitude of wanting to please really made our stay there a nice experience i would definitely stay there again they just did so many little things that added to our first visit to the los angeles area it was located on s beverly bl which was also convenient walking distance to grocery store drug store along with some restaurants and shopping tours also picked up there ,positive,4,0,4,4
3 star hotel with added extras excellent 3 star hotel location close to beverly hills attractions staff helpful and very nice rooms had the amenities of a 4  5 star hotel with little extras of lavander aromatherapy bed linen spray eye mask relaxation cd to help you sleep ear plugs down duvets 300 count linens the room was soundproofed we were next to the elevator but did not hear a sound the room was small due to being an older hotel but still enough room to spread out the lobby and pool area keep this a 3 star hotel check in and check out fast arrived early and were given a room got a good deal through priceline would stay here again ,positive,3,3,3,3
great place great value  stayed at the crown plaza for 5 nights at the beginning of this month at the start of two weeks touring booked direct on the intercontinental website paying 99 dollars a night  came to a little more in the end with taxes etc however this was brilliant value compared to most uk hotels  as a tip its worth joining this hotel groups priority club as you get a complimentary conti br fast plus rooms on certain floors i m not sure if these are better rooms however they were certainly large and well equiped i liked the location it felt safe  for la  had its own adequate parking and was quiet within the car park is a car rental firm  midway  worth considering if this is your first night away as i had an hours wait at the airport for my rental car definately would stay again when in la ,positive,5,0,5,4
disappointed after driving down from san francisco to la in early january 2004 we were expecting everything the crowne plaza however was disappointing the room was nice but cramped for two people the bed next to the bathroom just managed to allow the door to open but you could hear everything going on in the bathroom so not very private the water wouldn t drain whilst taking a shower so we stood in shampoo soap and conditioner until stepping out we called maintenance up who fixed it but the problem still occurred honestly we couldn t be bothered calling again the use of the internet downstairs in the lobby was good the nightlife on the strip on a thursday night was non existent and very disappointing venice beach fared better the following day ,negative,3,0,0,2
fab time at the crowne plaza my husband and i were due to spend nights 4 at this hotel in september after spending 4 nights in anaheim at disneyland upon our arrival we were greeted with a nightmare     we were told that there was no reservation in our name and that the hotel was fully booked for the first night of our stay  i couldnt believe it considering it had been booked with our tour operator for nearly a year  tony rebello the rooms division manager was brillant he went of his way to help us out we were taken to another hotel for the first night with no cost to us and then brought back to the crowne plaza in time for our early morning tour our room was lovely and all the staff were extremely friendly the hotel was spotless location was fine we will be returning to this hotel in 2006  we would love to return in 2005 but the credit card needs time to recover with the rest of our family highly recommended     ,positive,4,4,4,4
great start to our holiday we stayed at the crowne plaza for 4 nights during a week trip to la the room was booked directly through the hotels website the best price around one bit of advice i can say that we found during booking the room i ticked the box joining the crowne plaza priority points it is free and you collect points for staying towards other free nights we didnt really need this but me being me i like free things anyway we didnt find out until we arrived that ticking that box gave you access to priority bonuses the hotels top floor is reserved for executive rooms but the floor below is reserved for priority members also our room rate did not include breakfast but again being a priority member gave you access to a special members lounge 24hrs which served a free buffet breakfast in the mornings we tried breakfast in the hotels resturant one morning and it was a little basic and expensive the rooms were large and well kept and the only downside was that the aircon was a little noisy staff were friendly and very helpful and maids very very efficiant outside is a taxi rank and bus stop which gets you anywhere you want we didnt rent a car during our stay taxi from the airport was 30 and the buses got us around for the other 4 days no problem the hotel is good for most things in north la we got a taxi to universal studios  35 but took us through some very nice areas and showed us part of hollywood that tours didnt go to if you want to see all of la and universal and disney then i would recommend what we did stay a few nights in north la and a few in south la  anahiem  would definately return to the crowne plaza if staying in la again ,positive,4,3,4,4
great place we had a great experience here we got a great rate using priceline and were very pleased with our stay we used our priority club card and got discounted parking and free continental breakfast the lobby was very nice fast elevators and nice rooms the bathrooms are nothing special but that is fine with us the service was friendly and very accomodating highly recommended  ,positive,0,0,4,4

if you are looking for upscale don t look here even though i was upgraded to a nice sized one bedroom suite  i was staying free on my priority club points this hotel that touts itself as a luxury hotel and believe me this hotel is not luxurious they have renovated recently so the public areas seem pleasant at first glance however when you take a closer look the public areas are very dirty and not well maintained there was gum stuck to the wall in the lobby all 3 days i was there filthy glass entrance doors trash on the elevator floors dirty carpet etc the room seemed pretty clean except for the hair all over the bathroom floor gross the room itself had some nice touches but overall felt like an older holiday inn trying to disguise itself as something nicer service was indifferent except for the great concierge was helpful also not very luxurious was having to go out the front lobby doors to get to the pool which is located next to the street the club lounge was your basic hotel room with a cheap continental breakfast convenient but nothing special valet was understaffed  just the one bellman on staff one evening i had to get the car myself from the garage because he was too busy crowne plaze also announced it s new luxurious beds the bed was nice because it was brand new but actually very firm and not high quality location is ok if you have a car but not too much around walking distance this hotel is fine for basic no frills accomodations if you get a good low rate i wish i hadn t used my points here tho kind of a waste i would have stayed at a nicer holidayinn express ,negative,3,3,2,2
not a good experience the location is perfect for shopping and restaurants the lobby is beautiful    we checked in and once in our room realized it was cold we turned on the heater and waited for 3 hours the room never got warm     apparently the windows were not sealed they moved us to another room this room extremely hot    and the air conditioner did not work they move us a third time this room was small but it appeared to have working heat and air it was 130 am before we could finally settle down and rest the hotel management did not apologize or even offer an explanation   in fact the person at the front desk was rude we checked out the first thing the next morning and went to the hyatt which was wonderful i would never stay at this hotel again i understand things happen an apology would have been nice ,negative,4,0,0,2
professional service with one problem we recently stayed at the sofitel la for 17 nights overall the service was excellent  professional fast and gracious however there was one issue and the way it was handled was surprisingly unprofessional first the goodthe rooms are comfortable  bathroom shower is excellent and huge beds are pretty good  they re new which counts for a lot but a little on the soft side due to a featherbed turndown service at night with bottles of evian someone always at the front door to welcome you and open the door once there was no one at the door and one of the valets saw me coming and ran to open it for me we had breakfast at simon 5 or 6 times and it was excellent each time they serve excellent french press coffee  i m a terrible coffee snob  one morning i asked for a new cup as i had let my coffee turn lukewarm instead i got an entire fresh new pot of french press once they forgot the avocado in my omelet and rushed out an entire plate of avocado they also let us sit forever on the sunny mornings we also had dinner and drinks at simon stone rose  the scene is a little too much but the food was excellent best thing to order is off the menu it s the iron chef burger tiny perfect burger fries with truffle oil and a little milkshake don t miss it the fitness center was clean and open from 5am  helpful when you re on a shoot  they also provided bottles of evian chilled towels and brownies or muffins internet access and computers and headphones a pretty complete place to hang out the spa has very nice treatments  i did a facial and a massage  though it is very pricey i m from new york and this compares to the priciest spas here however you can t top having a massage in a relaxing setting just a couple minutes from your hotel bed the sauna is not open yet unfortunately but the locker room is nice what else the location can t be beat we walked to dinner many nights  not sure that s even possible in other parts of la also walked to shopping on the weekend there were a couple very minor service issues along the way the maid opened our door and came in one morning at 830am while we were still in bed  she apologized and quickly left and the shampoo and conditioner were not replaced for days and i had to call housekeeping to get new ones sent up  but they came quickly  not big deals ok now the bad after we had been there 10 days with two cars parked the front desk called up to confirm our credit card because of all the charges piling up what charges we asked oh the 26 per day per car charge that s 884 extra for parking the rental cars for our 17 days i went to the front desk to speak with the manager i don t have a problem with paying whatever needs to be paid but i thought it was wrong we weren t told there s no mention on the valet ticket they hand you there s no mention in the literature in the room there s no mention in the packet they give you at checkin and there s no option to park in a separate lot instead of apologizing for not informing us of the charge and making some small gesture of good will  for example a 25 credit to the restaurant or spa or something that wouldn t cost them much  or god forbid an apology they just said this is la and parking is at a premium yes i said i understand i m from new york i don t have a problem with paying for parking i have a problem with the hotel sneaking charges onto my credit card it s something a less professional place would do and doesn t fit with the rest of our experience here anyway it continued this way for a while with the manager refusing to acknolwedge that we should have been told and getting increasingly more huffy did i mention we were there for 17 nightsin the end i paid the 884 and consoled myself with taking a few extra brownies and bottles of evian from the fitness center it s still a very nice place and though it pains me to say it i would probably stay there again ,positive,4,4,3,4
like the room i like the location of the hotel  a short drive to rodeo drive  i think about 3 miles  and to sunset blvd it s also right across from the mall the room was also very nice big and with new furnitures  what we like most was the marble bathroom with adjustable shower pressurewe didn t eat at hotel during our stay so can t say the gym was pretty large and fully equipped but the equipments were a little old  ,positive,4,0,0,4

acceptable the sofitel is probably hit or miss and for me it was a miss the hotel looks nice and it is furnished in a way you would expect from a 4star place the service was very friendly and we had a decent time overall however we had a few problemseach minor but collectively annoyingduring our stay1 we arrived to find stains on our sheets and no soap in the bathroom and because we had arrived late we had to change the sheets ourselves 2 the walls between us and our neighbors were surprisingly thin at one point we could hear the local newscast on the tv next door as if it were showing in our room 3 this was the kickerit happened to rain on our last night there and all the water off the roof drained right onto a metal windowsill outside our window needless to say we slept very poorly even after housekeeping gave us some earplugs if it rains do not stay on the 4th floor interestingly when i complained to the front desk she said many of the guests had made similar complaints and that the hotel management was pushing for a renovation i won t be staying again until they do ,negative,0,0,0,2
needs work this is the third sofitel property my husband and i stayed at the other two were in europe we were fairly happy with the previous bookings and so we decided to try sofitel los angeles details were awry at this hotelath mirror placed too far to be useful dust on the furniture a toilet that splashed when flushed one robe provided instead of two knocking on the door and waking us early in the morning to deliver the newspaper instead of just leaving it so we may sleep undisturbed with the exception of the person who woke us up with the newspaper the staff was generally nice and helpfulhough more training would not hurt we probably would not recommend this sofitel property ,negative,0,0,0,2
great affordable location we chose to stay here on the advise of a friend that said the location was central to sites and studios in the area and the hotel was a good value they were right on all counts and the staff could not have been nicer and more helpful in getting us directions and dinner reservations the rooms were in very good shape and the property appears to have been recently remodeled the pool area was nice and sunny in the afternoon which was nice after a day out walking rodeo drive which is about a mile away for the location price and service we will definetly stay here again ,positive,4,0,4,4
the jewel in the crowne we won this holiday on the radio when we arrived at lax we were met by a shuttle service approx transfer time was 1 hour due to traffic and other drop off s check in was very straight forward they asked us if we would like to leave a credit card imprint or not there was no pressure to do so the room was a decent size with 2 queen sized beds and a large bright bathroom with shower and bath the room also had a cd player and a large television and coffee maker the ice machine was just down the hallway the location of the hotel was a little out of the way and without a car it would have been a struggle getting about i can highly recommend the car hire company under the hotels parking lot breakfast was excellent and plentiful overall for location and facilities this hotel was a little overpriced but what the heck it cost us nothing  i would stay here again as it made an ideal base for a fantastic holiday and will be in our memories forever ,positive,2,5,2,3
stay away at all cost we stayed there 3 days out of a weeks stay in the area nice hotel small rooms but the noise from people working in the hall ways was horrible not 8 to 5 during the day but 23 in the am they have all mexican workers doing the work who not only work all hours of the day and night but they also sleep in the hall ways and the linen closets i called several times to speak to the hotel manager and was told but the front desk that he was looking into it but never seen anyone take any action people where so pissed over the noise they where checking out 4 am as i did at 5 am on the third day of our stay because of the fighting in the hallways in the middle of the night the mother company of crown plaza gave us 500 for our trouble and picked up our other hotels tab the hotel itself is run 100 by mexicans and they harbor people not only in the stairways but the parking garage for cheap labor on the hotels refurbishing stay away at all cost          ,negative,0,0,0,1
awful this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in however it holds the hotel of the year award for 2001 for the chain but hey do not appear to have any clean bed sheets i found black hair and big yellow puddle stains on the sheets mattresses and comforters i requested to move rooms and the new room had the same problems housekeeping came and tried to clean the bed but had to open new sheets because the replacement sheets also had stains this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in based upon the quality of the bedroom what a disgusting hotel i checked out the same day ,negative,0,0,0,1
liked the hotel but reception staff were a bit dizzy recently stayed at the crowne plaza for 4 nights with husband and 8 month old baby we were part of a large group and had 7 rooms booked at the hotel we arrived and booked in but this took a while as the receptionist didn t really know what she was doing eventually we got checked in and went to our rooms reception also misadvised 2 of our party and said they were only booked in for 3 days instead of 4 which was incorrect but did cause us to worry the room was clean and tidy and had a large very comfortable bed the rooms were quiet and dark and we had a good view  we were on the 9th floor the room also had tea coffee facilities which was great for us to warm bottles baby food breakfast was buffet style or you could order off the menu the food was tasty and they had a good selection also they were accomodating for babies and had high chairs available hotel is well placed in beverly hills and was just a short walk to supermarket bars and restaurants and is close to rodeo drive felt safe walking round in the evening spoke to the concierge to book a trip to see stars homes etc  and we got a really good deal as there were 13 adults and 2 infants we were able to hire our own mini bus to take us to all the major sights and we could stop when we wanted to take photos we also booked the minibus to take us to and from universal studios and to the aurport which worked out much cheaper than using standard taxis would stay at this hotel again as it is very clean and comfortable and in a great location they just need to train their reception staff a bit better ,positive,4,4,4,4
not what you expect stayed at the crowne for 6 nights just because it is in beverly hills does not mean it is top of the line the rooms were very small the bathroom was rediculously small  take one step in turn around and sit on toilet step in shower or wash hands prison cells are bigger than this  staff was very pleasant and helpful bartender not very friendly plenty of sitting space in lounge and check in area we stayed on the 8th floor which included a small refrigerator  nice admenity  ,negative,3,0,0,2
don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,negative,4,0,1,1
abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,negative,0,0,0,1
it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,negative,0,3,2,0
ok hotel we enjoyed our stay at the crowne plaza we moved here from the hilton anaheim and the crowne plaza seemed really small in comparison the room was a bit tight for four people beds were comfortable and there was a good view from the room the staff were friendly and were helpful when booking town cars etc with regards to location it is about 30 mins from lax and 40 mins to universal studios it takes about 15 minutes to walk to rodeo drive and there are plenty of nice restaurants along the street for a bite to eat overall the hotel was nice and not too large but i would probably try somewhere else the next time ,positive,3,0,0,3
don t waste your money i would not recommend this hotel to anyone the pictures on the website were very disceiving i felt sick to my stomach when we arrived to the hotel itself when we fianally got to our room  via stairs i wanted to immediatly go elsewhere it was horrible inside we spent as much time as possible away from the place it was in a bad location and the people working the desk well that was a whole different matter if you are afraid of filthy places do not stay there       ,negative,1,0,0,2

awful just awful lemme tell ya  i want to know who their photographer is because i m sure he can make me look like marilyn monroe talk about making a dog look good   the rooms are nothing like what s pictured on the website there was a hole in the ceiling above the bed with crumbled plaster on the bedspread the jacuzzi suite was a jetted tub not the jacuzzi described furniture was not contemporary chic as it appears in the photos  it was just cheap and tacky cigarette butts and other trash were in the fountain in the weedy courtyard desk clerk was eating her lunch when we came in she never paused except to take a personal cell call she never paused either long enough to answer questions but continued as if we were an afterthought we canceled our stay and walked up the street to another hotel ,negative,0,0,0,1
do not stay at the hotel royal a group of stayed at this hotel for a family get together and it was an awful place the front desk individuals are for the most part unprofessional and unhelpful the rooms are filthy   unsanitary to say the least the towels were always stained dirty and they the sheets did not fit on the bed there were no bathroom toiletries  except for soap available and the water never got hot in the shower the balcony suites consisted of a window going out to a balcony that was about to fall off the side of the building   what a sham we were never able to sleep in past 7 am because of the noise on the street and coming from other rooms this was a huge disappointment you do not feel safe at the hotel and arrive home unrested and wanting to sanitize everything in your suitcase try somewhere else   you will be very unhappy here no matter what your standards are ,negative,0,0,0,2
this place is a total ripoff i cancelled my reservation to this hotel on october 1st and asked for my deposit back they told me i would have to talk to the manager susan smith because she s the only one who handles refunds that in itself seemed odd to me anyway i called her office almost every day since the 1st but she was never there i left countless messages with my phone number but she never called me back it s been over two weeks now and i ve spent lots of money on long distance calls but the hotel still owes me 223 74 deposit on two rooms i threatened to complain to the better business bureau but it did no good i guess they don t care about customer service i m just really glad i didn t actually stay at this hotel what horrible service   never stay at a hotel that requires a deposit on the room as you may never get it back if you cancel ,negative,0,0,1,1
shared similar experience with  junior suite as an earlier post stated i too was upgraded to the junior suite believe me there ain t nothing sweet about it my problems began in room 4 in the rear building the walls were filthy handprints smudges and god knows what else the windows were flush with the ceiling so no chance of seeing out the blinds were ready to fall out of one window the headboard had an inch of dirt on top the walls of the bathroom were covered in dust no closet space to speakof other than a homemade armoire 3x3x3 then the upgrade 6 flights of stairs from ground level   carpet on the last two flights was covered in dust than no one bothered to vacum an earlier post gave an accurate description of the room and its condition the continental breakfast were pastries straight out of wal mart packages the same stale pastries for 4 days why they don t have an arrangemnt with the pastierre around the corner is beyond me the front desk folks tried the best they could to make it a better stay but to no avail peter  the day clerk was the most helpful understanding person i have encountered yet if you do book a room ask for a courtyard room the showers are smaller than most broom closets but the rooms are great ,negative,0,0,0,2

good location and excellent service not perfect however   i booked the sofitel for a onenight stay on a midweek business trip to los angeles the hotel is nicely situated directly across from the beverly center one of la s best shopping malls good food and sightseeing options are right outside the door which is rare for la the hotel is modern and hip with very well kept grounds and an impressive entry area the rooms are also modern in appearance with flat panel tvs and sharp clean decor i found the service to be superior from the reception to the valet parking attendants no issues at checkin checkout or anywhere in between consistent with earlier reviews the room i was given was very small for the states if i was with my wife we would have been cramped but for one the size was fine i also found the room to be otherwise spotless and comfortable with a good view of the busy la street scene below the bed was comfortable and i slept well so in all i would recommend the sofitel for travelers to la or those on business it is well located and can be a good value especially if you shop around on discount internet websites ,positive,4,4,4,4
acceptable the sofitel is probably hit or miss and for me it was a miss the hotel looks nice and it is furnished in a way you would expect from a 4star place the service was very friendly and we had a decent time overall however we had a few problemseach minor but collectively annoyingduring our stay1 we arrived to find stains on our sheets and no soap in the bathroom and because we had arrived late we had to change the sheets ourselves 2 the walls between us and our neighbors were surprisingly thin at one point we could hear the local newscast on the tv next door as if it were showing in our room 3 this was the kickerit happened to rain on our last night there and all the water off the roof drained right onto a metal windowsill outside our window needless to say we slept very poorly even after housekeeping gave us some earplugs if it rains do not stay on the 4th floor interestingly when i complained to the front desk she said many of the guests had made similar complaints and that the hotel management was pushing for a renovation i won t be staying again until they do ,negative,0,0,0,2
needs work this is the third sofitel property my husband and i stayed at the other two were in europe we were fairly happy with the previous bookings and so we decided to try sofitel los angeles details were awry at this hotelath mirror placed too far to be useful dust on the furniture a toilet that splashed when flushed one robe provided instead of two knocking on the door and waking us early in the morning to deliver the newspaper instead of just leaving it so we may sleep undisturbed with the exception of the person who woke us up with the newspaper the staff was generally nice and helpfulhough more training would not hurt we probably would not recommend this sofitel property ,negative,0,0,0,2
good surprise we recently stayed at this hotel because we needed to be in beverly hills for 2 nights and the four seasons was sold out well that turned out to be a good thing for us i will no longer jump to spend over 500 night to stay at this four seasons there s nothing wrong with the crowne plaza at one third the price you get a comfortable bed spectravision good housekeeping a very decent room and a great location and it doesn t cost a fortune note if you need quiet which we do make sure to book the top floor it s the designated quiet floor we were fine up there no it doesn t compare to a 5 star hotel but neither does it s price for what it is it s above average don t be afraid to use it ,positive,4,0,4,3
stay away at all cost we stayed there 3 days out of a weeks stay in the area nice hotel small rooms but the noise from people working in the hall ways was horrible not 8 to 5 during the day but 23 in the am they have all mexican workers doing the work who not only work all hours of the day and night but they also sleep in the hall ways and the linen closets i called several times to speak to the hotel manager and was told but the front desk that he was looking into it but never seen anyone take any action people where so pissed over the noise they where checking out 4 am as i did at 5 am on the third day of our stay because of the fighting in the hallways in the middle of the night the mother company of crown plaza gave us 500 for our trouble and picked up our other hotels tab the hotel itself is run 100 by mexicans and they harbor people not only in the stairways but the parking garage for cheap labor on the hotels refurbishing stay away at all cost          ,negative,0,0,0,1
got an upgrade we arrived at this hotel in the small hours of the morning and were given a room on the 4th floor when we tried to get into the room the lock was on the door so my husband went down to reception to find out what was going on we were told that sometimes the locks do catch but that we would be given an upgrade to an executive room on the 12th floor room was large and had a king size bed bathroom not very big but adequate with plenty of towels hairdrier and cosmetics on the bed was a gauze bag with earplugs sleep mask and lavender linen spray we had breakfast in the dining room and both the buffet and the ala carte menu were good large servings and well cooked and presented the staff were very attentive and friendly also ate dinner there one night and thoroughly enjoyed it reception staff were very helpful when i needed to find a book shop even providing me with a map so i knew exactly where i was and how far the book shop would be i would recommend this hotel ,positive,0,4,0,4
awful this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in however it holds the hotel of the year award for 2001 for the chain but hey do not appear to have any clean bed sheets i found black hair and big yellow puddle stains on the sheets mattresses and comforters i requested to move rooms and the new room had the same problems housekeeping came and tried to clean the bed but had to open new sheets because the replacement sheets also had stains this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in based upon the quality of the bedroom what a disgusting hotel i checked out the same day ,negative,0,0,0,1

not what you expect stayed at the crowne for 6 nights just because it is in beverly hills does not mean it is top of the line the rooms were very small the bathroom was rediculously small  take one step in turn around and sit on toilet step in shower or wash hands prison cells are bigger than this  staff was very pleasant and helpful bartender not very friendly plenty of sitting space in lounge and check in area we stayed on the 8th floor which included a small refrigerator  nice admenity  ,negative,3,0,0,2
don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,negative,4,0,1,1
abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,negative,0,0,0,1
a comfortable stay i was here for two nights in june my second stay at the crowne plaza i found it to be very comfortable both stays and since i often have business nearby will undoubtably stay again check in went well and the desk staff was very helpful my rooms both times were as requested and were large with nice views lots of light very comfortable beds a lounger and an ottoman and wellapppointed bathrooms wireless that worked well quiet     no complaints though i agree with those that say that the breakfast is soso here however it is walking distance from several other restaurants the location is quite convienent for west side activities a good value for what you get and for beverly hills recommended ,positive,4,3,4,4

nice hotel not great tourist area we stayed at the crowne plaza for 2 nights at the end of our world tour the hotel was nice clean and the staff were very friendly we were given a large room on the 7th floor it was surprisingly big with 2 double beds free internet access at 2 computers in the lobby is available tho there is usally a queue the 1 major complaint i have with the hotel is the location there isn t much to do after dark there are a couple of nice places to eat on pico one diner which serves amazing lunch and a pretty pricey restauant both about 5mins walk from the hotel but other than that there s nowhere to hang out rodeo drive is a good 1520min walk and here you ll find some eateries on the way  bring your visa card   we struggled to find places to shop after saving alot of money to go mad here i came home with alot of it also car hire is a must we had been warned of this before but decided that as we were only here for 2 days and were arriving on st patricks day  we re irish so didn t want to be unable to enjoy a drink    anyway we spent a fortune on taxis and i m convinced they went halfway round the world for a short cut so be careful the slight negative thing i would say about the hotel is that we tried to order room service albeit at 10 50 when they stop at 11 but they made no effort to find us an alternative or offer something that takes a few minutes to rustle up other than that no complaints ,positive,4,4,3,4
most enjoyable stay we recently spent 10 nights at this location while on a family vacation the location was great and the staff was excellent they were helpful in every manner possible the rooms were spacious and clean  we had a suite and free internet was very useful john the conceirge was great at recommending attractions and giving directions many useful amenities were close by including a ralph s supermarket numerous dry cleaners and many resturants would certainly stay here again ,positive,4,0,0,5
reliable option in los angeles i recently stayed at the crowne plaza beverly hills for 3 days in june 2006 and i have to say i have only one real complaint although the complaint i have is not to be undervalued we arrived a little after 300 pm and were told that our room was not ready this is of course a little unnerving after travelling for about 7 hours but understandable if the problem is taken care of quickly we waited for over an hour before being let into our room which was not even made up to drop off our luggage we decided rather than sit in the hotel and wait for our room to be cleaned we would go exploring we came back to the hotel several hours later and our rooms were finally cleaned this was the only real complaint i had during our stay but as i said it is a really big complaint the best thing about this hotel are the beds i have stayed in many intercontinental hotels most recently in atlanta and i must say they have the most comfortable hotel beds i have ever slept in it is good to see that intercontinental has made the commitment to upgrade the crowne plaza hotel range bedding as well even if there was no featherbed the hotel decor is very much like a holiday inn but this is considered a value hotel and no one should expect the ritz when staying here the continental breakfast served in the mornings for priority club members is a wonderful value and just the thing to start a busy day of exploring and shopping another hotel perk so to speak was the use of the 24 hour fitness gym about a 1 4 of a mile down the road from the hotel the facility has workout machines free weights cardio machines as well as organized classes which can all be accessed by crowne plaza guests for free now as for the hotel s location anyone coming to los angeles should understand that no location in los angeles is ever entirely convenient if you do not have a car it is very hard to move around the city the crowne plaza is only a 15 minute walk to rodeo dr and is right on beverly which has a number of restaurants and shops all within walking distance of the hotel if you can handle a tedious checkin as we did the crowne plaza is a reliable valuehotel option in los angeles within reasonable driving distance to many attractions and offers guests comfortable beds complimentary fitness center privileges and a good continental breakfast what more can someone ask for in this price range ,positive,2,4,4,4
expected more i stayed at this hotel for three nights based on reviews from tripadvisor after arriving on a 13 hour flight we just wanted to check in and sleep we were told our room would be ready in half an hour and they would let us know when it was ready we waited patiently in the foyer    two hours later i asked what was happening and was told oh sorry i forget to let you know  your room was ready over an hour ago exhausted and frustrated we finally made it to bed the room was nice  spacious and clean but the walls were paper thin and we were kept awake at 1am with television and converstation in the next room we could hear word for word what they were saying i am a priority club member and was given the free breakfast which was very good on the last day the concierge arranged for a town car to take us to the airport five minutes after booking he called our room to confirm that it was indeed booked when the town car never showed up we asked the bellman about it who asked somebody else who said oh yeah    he cancelled five minutes later we were told that it was never booked at all we were left to find our own way to the aiport the location is in the middle of nowhere i would not stay here again ,negative,0,4,0,2

excellent hotel  great location stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our 15 night stay in the usa booked the hotel through the holiday inn website  as a priority club member  which is free to join  was very surprised at the rate quoted  only 99  tax we booked a 2 x queen bed room  non smoking upon arrival at the hotel  following the excellent driving instructions from the website we were checked in prompty and very effeciently and directed to our rooms as a priority club member tey have special floors in certain hotels  we arrived at our rooms and were very very impressed wth what greated us high floor view of la with the hollywood sign in the distance 2 queen beds with feather duvet feather topper and great pillows air conditioning that worked and welcome letters from the general manager and priority club manager crowne plaza also have recently introduced a sleep programe  so on the bed was a cd for helping you to drift off into a deep sleep some lavender pillow mist ear plugs and an eye mask all very nice little touches used the hotels valet parking at 18 50 per night  to be honest it is more cost efficeint to use the hotels self parking at only 14 00 per night  as it is under the hotel and you dont have to keep tipping the concierge everytime you need your car keys as a priority club member this also entitles you to a free continental breakfast which includes juices tea coffee yoghurt cereals bagels muffins you can also upgrade for 5 to the buffet breakfast which we did on one morning and had a cooked breakfast all in all i would definetly stay at this hotel again  its location is excellent being on the outskirts of beverly hills and only 2 or 3 blocks from rodeo drive  we felt safe and walked down to a couple of restaurants in the evenings join the priority club to get the comp b fast and the priority floor  ,positive,4,4,3,4

a but shabby and not chic we stayed here for one night in december and i would have to say i would not stay here again we did get a good rate from lastminute so for the price i can t complain too much the lobby is nice enough but the wallpaper in the hallways is peeling there were dishes and plates all along the floor in the hallway the rooms were okay nothing special the hotel is located in an area that s off the beaten path there are restaurants in the hotel and down the road but i just didn t feel comfortable walking there at night with just my young son the staff was all nice enough no problem there we stayed at loews beverly hills around the corner a few weeks before and it was more expensive but much nicer ,negative,2,0,3,3
somewhere between very good  this is the second time i ve been here on business i like the fact that they have free wifi internet and what everyone has said about the staff i double that extremely courteous i only had occasion to eat one meal  room service and it was excellent i was on the club level the room was fine in terms of size the connecting door is a disadvantage ie the tour of italians returned at two in the morning hammered and sat next door and laughed for an hour very loud for me the location was great my client is right up pico about five minutes i d recommend this for people who have never been to so cal and are here on tourism of which there seem to be quite a few here ,positive,4,5,0,4
roll out the red carpet i can say i truly enjoyed the hotel upon checkin there is a beautiful lobby and vallet service is efficient and friendly  only a few more dollars per night  i would recommend doing the whole vallet thing because the parking garage is a bit of a pain we probably used the vallet service 3 or more times per day of course coming in and out to see all the different area attractions the rooms are just average  used to be a holiday inn although the beds are luxury first good night sleep i d had in awhile no fan in the bathroom no minifridge or wetbar no balcony although there are beautiful views of the beverly hills downtown area i wouldn t recommend walking to rodeo drive you ll need a car in l a there s no complimentary breakfast  you have to be a priority member  the business center came to a convenience although there is a a charge to use it the pool was too cold in october i don t think it s heated but we got drinks from the bar and enjoyed the whirlpool jacuzzi this is a good place to stay for the cost i think we paid 100 per night i would recommend it more for business than pleasure ,positive,4,0,4,4

if you are looking for upscale don t look here even though i was upgraded to a nice sized one bedroom suite  i was staying free on my priority club points this hotel that touts itself as a luxury hotel and believe me this hotel is not luxurious they have renovated recently so the public areas seem pleasant at first glance however when you take a closer look the public areas are very dirty and not well maintained there was gum stuck to the wall in the lobby all 3 days i was there filthy glass entrance doors trash on the elevator floors dirty carpet etc the room seemed pretty clean except for the hair all over the bathroom floor gross the room itself had some nice touches but overall felt like an older holiday inn trying to disguise itself as something nicer service was indifferent except for the great concierge was helpful also not very luxurious was having to go out the front lobby doors to get to the pool which is located next to the street the club lounge was your basic hotel room with a cheap continental breakfast convenient but nothing special valet was understaffed  just the one bellman on staff one evening i had to get the car myself from the garage because he was too busy crowne plaze also announced it s new luxurious beds the bed was nice because it was brand new but actually very firm and not high quality location is ok if you have a car but not too much around walking distance this hotel is fine for basic no frills accomodations if you get a good low rate i wish i hadn t used my points here tho kind of a waste i would have stayed at a nicer holidayinn express ,negative,3,3,2,2

don t make my mistake i have read the reviews of this property albeit too late i have just returned from a stay at the royal inn unfortunately i must agree with the majority of trip advisor users this was the worst hotel experience of my life that includes an overnight emergency stay at the travellodge in downtown chicago where some of the rooms must have rented by the hour this property is filthy the staff is uncaring and or inept i m not sure if they even have an onsite cleaning staff i certainly never saw any while i was there and my room was never cleaned the shower was dreadful the trickle of water was unbelievable i kept waiting for the pressure to build but it never did i m suspicious that the review about the upgrade to a master suite is a planted posting unless they didn t post for a long time after their trip i was just there  latenov and saw no evidence of any improvements being made many are needed  ,negative,2,0,0,1

unbelievable we have been staying at the rue royale for years it used to be a quaint inn with an acceptably shabby ambiance that you come to expect and even desire in new orleans with new management it has become a nightmare   we decided to brave the unspeakably tacky lobby renovation due to the fantastic location of the property and visit as a group to celebrate a friend s birthday we booked in july on wednesday night before we were to arrive on friday morning we got a call informing us that our rooms had suffered a water leak and our reservations had been cancelled they refused to help find other rooms basically telling us that they were sorry but managements decision was final nola was booked for the timeframe  1 day in advance so we had to cancell our trip the nicest thing i can say about the management at this point is i hope someone catches them in a crosswalk so their new nickname can be speed bump  ,negative,0,0,0,1

acceptable the sofitel is probably hit or miss and for me it was a miss the hotel looks nice and it is furnished in a way you would expect from a 4star place the service was very friendly and we had a decent time overall however we had a few problemseach minor but collectively annoyingduring our stay1 we arrived to find stains on our sheets and no soap in the bathroom and because we had arrived late we had to change the sheets ourselves 2 the walls between us and our neighbors were surprisingly thin at one point we could hear the local newscast on the tv next door as if it were showing in our room 3 this was the kickerit happened to rain on our last night there and all the water off the roof drained right onto a metal windowsill outside our window needless to say we slept very poorly even after housekeeping gave us some earplugs if it rains do not stay on the 4th floor interestingly when i complained to the front desk she said many of the guests had made similar complaints and that the hotel management was pushing for a renovation i won t be staying again until they do ,negative,0,0,0,2
needs work this is the third sofitel property my husband and i stayed at the other two were in europe we were fairly happy with the previous bookings and so we decided to try sofitel los angeles details were awry at this hotelath mirror placed too far to be useful dust on the furniture a toilet that splashed when flushed one robe provided instead of two knocking on the door and waking us early in the morning to deliver the newspaper instead of just leaving it so we may sleep undisturbed with the exception of the person who woke us up with the newspaper the staff was generally nice and helpfulhough more training would not hurt we probably would not recommend this sofitel property ,negative,0,0,0,2
good surprise we recently stayed at this hotel because we needed to be in beverly hills for 2 nights and the four seasons was sold out well that turned out to be a good thing for us i will no longer jump to spend over 500 night to stay at this four seasons there s nothing wrong with the crowne plaza at one third the price you get a comfortable bed spectravision good housekeeping a very decent room and a great location and it doesn t cost a fortune note if you need quiet which we do make sure to book the top floor it s the designated quiet floor we were fine up there no it doesn t compare to a 5 star hotel but neither does it s price for what it is it s above average don t be afraid to use it ,positive,4,0,4,3
a lovely hotel despite a slight hitch when checking in i had a very pleasant experience in this hotel the reception area has a nice upmarket feel to it and the reception staff were very helpful complimentary citrus water was provided as was free internet access the room itself was clean very comfortable and quite good value for money i would definitely recommend this hotel ,positive,0,0,4,4
stay away at all cost we stayed there 3 days out of a weeks stay in the area nice hotel small rooms but the noise from people working in the hall ways was horrible not 8 to 5 during the day but 23 in the am they have all mexican workers doing the work who not only work all hours of the day and night but they also sleep in the hall ways and the linen closets i called several times to speak to the hotel manager and was told but the front desk that he was looking into it but never seen anyone take any action people where so pissed over the noise they where checking out 4 am as i did at 5 am on the third day of our stay because of the fighting in the hallways in the middle of the night the mother company of crown plaza gave us 500 for our trouble and picked up our other hotels tab the hotel itself is run 100 by mexicans and they harbor people not only in the stairways but the parking garage for cheap labor on the hotels refurbishing stay away at all cost          ,negative,0,0,0,1
awful this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in however it holds the hotel of the year award for 2001 for the chain but hey do not appear to have any clean bed sheets i found black hair and big yellow puddle stains on the sheets mattresses and comforters i requested to move rooms and the new room had the same problems housekeeping came and tried to clean the bed but had to open new sheets because the replacement sheets also had stains this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in based upon the quality of the bedroom what a disgusting hotel i checked out the same day ,negative,0,0,0,1
great hotel but room was a bit small my wife and i had overlapping business trips to la so i joined her a few days early she was booked  the crowne plaza in beverly hills  i stayed 2 nights with her the first thing we noticed was that the staff was extremely nice  helpful according to my wife there was problem w the original room  i never saw it as i was unloading the car  but we were immediately switched to another room  on the 11th floor   unbelievable view  the room was a little small  especially the bathroom   just big enough to shut the door  turn around in  but adequate the room had all the expected amenities  a microfridge the bed  pillows were extremely comfortable the bar lounge seemed nice but the restaurant was average at best overall a very nice place ,positive,4,3,0,4
thanks bobby my grandaughter and i stayed here in november 2007 we loved the hotel  although it was a bit far away from places where we wanted to see we used the valet service most times and found this excellent the drivers were great and very helpful we can t speak highly enough of the doorman come porter bobby who went out of his way to help us with our tour problems we had to leave a day early but this was no problem with the desk staff once again thanks to you all  ,positive,3,2,0,4
not what you expect stayed at the crowne for 6 nights just because it is in beverly hills does not mean it is top of the line the rooms were very small the bathroom was rediculously small  take one step in turn around and sit on toilet step in shower or wash hands prison cells are bigger than this  staff was very pleasant and helpful bartender not very friendly plenty of sitting space in lounge and check in area we stayed on the 8th floor which included a small refrigerator  nice admenity  ,negative,3,0,0,2
very pleasant hotel the hotel is conveniently located the rooms are big with all what you need for a confortable stay including this dream box for relax that crowne plaza has on all their rooms conveniently located minutes ago from teathers shopping malls and all the action you might look for in beverly hills staff is friendly and they have a nice self parking lot i really have very good memories of this hotel that will be a good option for my next trip to beverly hills  ,positive,4,0,0,4
don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,negative,4,0,1,1
abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,negative,0,0,0,1
it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,negative,0,3,2,0
great hotel great staff   awesome beds   stayed at the plaza for 4 nights on our trip round california and after reading a few reviews wasnt sure what to expect my experiance of this hotel was wonderful right from the minute we walked in the stuff were friendly and helpful the bar staff room service  the beds  i could have slept there forever the only downside was that it was a bit quiet at night around the hotel but we had been out allday so that wasnt a problem for us i would stay there again but you do need a car to see the area me personally i find all that rodeo drive stuff a bit of a laugh head for santa monica venice for clothing etc  much more to see and do ,positive,3,0,0,4

so this is beverly hills i had no issues with the crowne plaza at all the room was clean and comfortable i guess i was expecting a little more from beverly hills itself rodeo drive is a nice hike from the hotel and smaller than i envisioned the map of bh the hotel provides is somewhat deceptive as it omits several streets and makes places appear closer than they actually are the immediate area around the crown plaza has a gas station ralph s longs and a few restaurants delis there really wasn t much of a night life i could find and it seemed like most places shut down at 5 i probably wouldn t stay in bh again but if you really wanted to tell others you spent the night in beverly hills the crowne plaza would be a reasonable choice ,positive,4,0,3,3

a nicely located hotel with friendly staff and good services we had a good time here the room was nice the staff were very friendly and accomodating to our family its an easy walk to cafes and restaurants nearby and the neighbourhood felt very safe to walk around at night even with small children the pool jacuzzi was an instant hit with our 7 year old its the sort of hotel that grows on you because the staff make you feel comfortable and at home which is what you want on vacation i ve stayed in a lot flasher hotels which i ve left feeling not as satisfied as i did staying here they could do with another internet computer though one doesn t seem to be enough at busy times ,positive,4,0,0,4
very nice overall my wife and i visited la for the first time this past june and the crown plaza turned out to be a good choice located on the fringes of beverly hills the neighborhood was clean and safe most of our sightseeing was confined to west la and the beaches so the location was convenient the hotel itself is generally well kept and the staff without exception was very friendly and accommodating the complimentary continental breakfast  for priority club members a free service  was a good alternative for those mornings when we wanted to grab something and go we d certainly stay here again the clarks cape coral fl ,positive,4,4,0,4
reliable option in los angeles i recently stayed at the crowne plaza beverly hills for 3 days in june 2006 and i have to say i have only one real complaint although the complaint i have is not to be undervalued we arrived a little after 300 pm and were told that our room was not ready this is of course a little unnerving after travelling for about 7 hours but understandable if the problem is taken care of quickly we waited for over an hour before being let into our room which was not even made up to drop off our luggage we decided rather than sit in the hotel and wait for our room to be cleaned we would go exploring we came back to the hotel several hours later and our rooms were finally cleaned this was the only real complaint i had during our stay but as i said it is a really big complaint the best thing about this hotel are the beds i have stayed in many intercontinental hotels most recently in atlanta and i must say they have the most comfortable hotel beds i have ever slept in it is good to see that intercontinental has made the commitment to upgrade the crowne plaza hotel range bedding as well even if there was no featherbed the hotel decor is very much like a holiday inn but this is considered a value hotel and no one should expect the ritz when staying here the continental breakfast served in the mornings for priority club members is a wonderful value and just the thing to start a busy day of exploring and shopping another hotel perk so to speak was the use of the 24 hour fitness gym about a 1 4 of a mile down the road from the hotel the facility has workout machines free weights cardio machines as well as organized classes which can all be accessed by crowne plaza guests for free now as for the hotel s location anyone coming to los angeles should understand that no location in los angeles is ever entirely convenient if you do not have a car it is very hard to move around the city the crowne plaza is only a 15 minute walk to rodeo dr and is right on beverly which has a number of restaurants and shops all within walking distance of the hotel if you can handle a tedious checkin as we did the crowne plaza is a reliable valuehotel option in los angeles within reasonable driving distance to many attractions and offers guests comfortable beds complimentary fitness center privileges and a good continental breakfast what more can someone ask for in this price range ,positive,2,4,4,4
expected more i stayed at this hotel for three nights based on reviews from tripadvisor after arriving on a 13 hour flight we just wanted to check in and sleep we were told our room would be ready in half an hour and they would let us know when it was ready we waited patiently in the foyer    two hours later i asked what was happening and was told oh sorry i forget to let you know  your room was ready over an hour ago exhausted and frustrated we finally made it to bed the room was nice  spacious and clean but the walls were paper thin and we were kept awake at 1am with television and converstation in the next room we could hear word for word what they were saying i am a priority club member and was given the free breakfast which was very good on the last day the concierge arranged for a town car to take us to the airport five minutes after booking he called our room to confirm that it was indeed booked when the town car never showed up we asked the bellman about it who asked somebody else who said oh yeah    he cancelled five minutes later we were told that it was never booked at all we were left to find our own way to the aiport the location is in the middle of nowhere i would not stay here again ,negative,0,4,0,2
lovely we stayed here at the end of april 06 and had no problems clean service was good  breakfast good  you are entitled to it only if you register online as a priority club member before making reservation  which is free  staff friendly and helpful while the hotel is further out everything else is also spread out so no hotel is central unless you want to pay 300 u s  night in hollywood would recommend renting a car no matter where you stayed as this would eliminate expensive taxis would stay here again ,positive,3,4,3,4
this hotel is run down we stayed 2 nights on vacation trip the hotel has been elegant but is terribly run down stains on the carpet breakfast trays which were not removed for days stains on the elevator mirror not removed for days we asked for a quiet room and got a free upgrade to the quite zone in on of the top floors advertized with no slamming doors no loud tv s etc   the room was o k but a very small bathroom having the door right to the beds  no privacy after midnight the guy next to us started a discussion with his wife partner so we coud head every word walls like paper fortunately he stopped after 20 minutes it is a pity this nice hotle is run down that bad it could be much better having proper management it does not compare to other crowne plaza s we know  vienna rome hamburg ,negative,0,0,0,2

great location stayed here for 5 nights showed my priority club card upon checkin as advised by other tripadvisor members received free breakfast for 2 during the stay they first gave me a room next to the coke and ice machines on the 9th flour not good if you value your sleep but upon request on the front desk immediately got a different room on the 8th floor and slept perfectly good central location if you want to visit the santa monica area or the hollywood area save neighbourhood good restaurants nearby if you do not want to walk to rodeo or beverly hills restaurant shopping areas take the bus only 3 for a day pass and in this area there are no  strange people on the bus yet bus stop is in front of the hotel  bus 14  some minor cleaning issues in the room  there is indeed a pile of dust on the ventilation in the badroom and i found some hairs of previous guests on the badroom wall but overall cleaning is good and the hotel has new carpets beds and room furniture  or at least it looks new and friendly staff would recommend it and stay again ,positive,4,3,4,4
budget hotel  deceived by tripadvisor ratings this hotel was run down the service was mediocre the beds were advertised as new comfortable beds they were not   we could not sleep on our squeeky sloping beds most of the dishes at the continental breakfast were dirty elevator area was very dirty the walls were soiled concierge is available during day bellmen take over in the evening bellman could not provide any information even approximate time distance info to ronald reagan library 40 minutes away eye level wall vent in bathroom had an inch of accumulated dust dirt debris in it i would not return to this hotel ,negative,2,0,3,2
great  have just spent 3 nights here on a stop over to australia  this hotel is great  large rooms with very comfotable beds  the hotel has put a great effort into it s sleep programe  including sleep packs in the rooms and even cd s to help aid sleep and relaxation  which they are more than happy for you to take with you  make sure you join the priority programe before you visit as it includes a free breakfast which was a great money saver  it s also served in the members lounge which is a bit quieter on a morning  room service was great  and not too bad value for money  gorgeous pizzas   i agree with the previous poster  we also walked to rodeo drive and felt perfectly safe  i can recomend eating there as well  we found a pavement cafe and got lunch for a very resonable price  it was worth the money alone just to people watch  the hotel can arrange your transfer to the airport  which is the same price as a taxi  but you get to go in a limo which is much more comfortable  the staff were great  but they did sometimes struggle to understand a yorshire accent  i would definatly stay here again ,positive,4,4,5,5
a but shabby and not chic we stayed here for one night in december and i would have to say i would not stay here again we did get a good rate from lastminute so for the price i can t complain too much the lobby is nice enough but the wallpaper in the hallways is peeling there were dishes and plates all along the floor in the hallway the rooms were okay nothing special the hotel is located in an area that s off the beaten path there are restaurants in the hotel and down the road but i just didn t feel comfortable walking there at night with just my young son the staff was all nice enough no problem there we stayed at loews beverly hills around the corner a few weeks before and it was more expensive but much nicer ,negative,2,0,3,3

crowne plaza generally good we had a short stay at the crowne plaza and found it to be a pleasant hotel and good value for money it had comfortable beds plenty of towels and all the usual amenities the cd player was a bonus the inroom coffee was awful the only thing we missed was a refrigerator in the room the location is excellent you can walk to a variety of restaurants shops and a supermarket though all the distances are rather long a bus to downtown via the restaurant area stops outside and various other bus lines are not too far away there is even a bus from beverly hills to the airport but we did not use it presumably if you were on a tight budget you could  buses 1 25  the staff were friendly and efficient with one exception we tried to book a tour but instead of telling us that it was not available the concierge first tried to get us to do it by limo and then rather aggressively started to sign us up for a different tour also another concierge was very reluctant to get us a taxi and wanted us to take the hotel s car  40  we insisted on a taxi and it turned out to be cheaper  28  ,positive,5,0,3,4
fantastic stay at the crowne plaza we stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills from july 20  23 and had a wonderful time from the moment we set foot in the door to the time we left all the staff were friendly and the facilities were excellent just as a tip to all future guests  make sure you sign up for the priority club  free to join  this entitles you to free breakfast each morning and there are dedicated floors within the hotel which are especially for priority club guests which have better views comfier beds the location of the crown plaza is around a 25minute walk to rodeo drive and approximately 3035 taxi ride to chinatown and downtown hollywood and approximately 25 30 to universal studios this means that if you do not have your own transport getting around could be difficult we were very impressed when one day we wanted to go to universal studios and were contemplating taking the bus train one of the hotel staff members who had just finished work for the day offered to drop us off to universal studio s on his way home as he lived in the area overall the level of customer service we received from all staff members at the crown plaza was excellent and i would definately recommend others to stay here also ,positive,4,4,3,4

great place great value  stayed at the crown plaza for 5 nights at the beginning of this month at the start of two weeks touring booked direct on the intercontinental website paying 99 dollars a night  came to a little more in the end with taxes etc however this was brilliant value compared to most uk hotels  as a tip its worth joining this hotel groups priority club as you get a complimentary conti br fast plus rooms on certain floors i m not sure if these are better rooms however they were certainly large and well equiped i liked the location it felt safe  for la  had its own adequate parking and was quiet within the car park is a car rental firm  midway  worth considering if this is your first night away as i had an hours wait at the airport for my rental car definately would stay again when in la ,positive,5,0,5,4
disappointed after driving down from san francisco to la in early january 2004 we were expecting everything the crowne plaza however was disappointing the room was nice but cramped for two people the bed next to the bathroom just managed to allow the door to open but you could hear everything going on in the bathroom so not very private the water wouldn t drain whilst taking a shower so we stood in shampoo soap and conditioner until stepping out we called maintenance up who fixed it but the problem still occurred honestly we couldn t be bothered calling again the use of the internet downstairs in the lobby was good the nightlife on the strip on a thursday night was non existent and very disappointing venice beach fared better the following day ,negative,3,0,0,2

if you are looking for upscale don t look here even though i was upgraded to a nice sized one bedroom suite  i was staying free on my priority club points this hotel that touts itself as a luxury hotel and believe me this hotel is not luxurious they have renovated recently so the public areas seem pleasant at first glance however when you take a closer look the public areas are very dirty and not well maintained there was gum stuck to the wall in the lobby all 3 days i was there filthy glass entrance doors trash on the elevator floors dirty carpet etc the room seemed pretty clean except for the hair all over the bathroom floor gross the room itself had some nice touches but overall felt like an older holiday inn trying to disguise itself as something nicer service was indifferent except for the great concierge was helpful also not very luxurious was having to go out the front lobby doors to get to the pool which is located next to the street the club lounge was your basic hotel room with a cheap continental breakfast convenient but nothing special valet was understaffed  just the one bellman on staff one evening i had to get the car myself from the garage because he was too busy crowne plaze also announced it s new luxurious beds the bed was nice because it was brand new but actually very firm and not high quality location is ok if you have a car but not too much around walking distance this hotel is fine for basic no frills accomodations if you get a good low rate i wish i hadn t used my points here tho kind of a waste i would have stayed at a nicer holidayinn express ,negative,3,3,2,2
not a good experience the location is perfect for shopping and restaurants the lobby is beautiful    we checked in and once in our room realized it was cold we turned on the heater and waited for 3 hours the room never got warm     apparently the windows were not sealed they moved us to another room this room extremely hot    and the air conditioner did not work they move us a third time this room was small but it appeared to have working heat and air it was 130 am before we could finally settle down and rest the hotel management did not apologize or even offer an explanation   in fact the person at the front desk was rude we checked out the first thing the next morning and went to the hyatt which was wonderful i would never stay at this hotel again i understand things happen an apology would have been nice ,negative,4,0,0,2

like the room i like the location of the hotel  a short drive to rodeo drive  i think about 3 miles  and to sunset blvd it s also right across from the mall the room was also very nice big and with new furnitures  what we like most was the marble bathroom with adjustable shower pressurewe didn t eat at hotel during our stay so can t say the gym was pretty large and fully equipped but the equipments were a little old  ,positive,4,0,0,4
good surprise we recently stayed at this hotel because we needed to be in beverly hills for 2 nights and the four seasons was sold out well that turned out to be a good thing for us i will no longer jump to spend over 500 night to stay at this four seasons there s nothing wrong with the crowne plaza at one third the price you get a comfortable bed spectravision good housekeeping a very decent room and a great location and it doesn t cost a fortune note if you need quiet which we do make sure to book the top floor it s the designated quiet floor we were fine up there no it doesn t compare to a 5 star hotel but neither does it s price for what it is it s above average don t be afraid to use it ,positive,4,0,4,3
stay away at all cost we stayed there 3 days out of a weeks stay in the area nice hotel small rooms but the noise from people working in the hall ways was horrible not 8 to 5 during the day but 23 in the am they have all mexican workers doing the work who not only work all hours of the day and night but they also sleep in the hall ways and the linen closets i called several times to speak to the hotel manager and was told but the front desk that he was looking into it but never seen anyone take any action people where so pissed over the noise they where checking out 4 am as i did at 5 am on the third day of our stay because of the fighting in the hallways in the middle of the night the mother company of crown plaza gave us 500 for our trouble and picked up our other hotels tab the hotel itself is run 100 by mexicans and they harbor people not only in the stairways but the parking garage for cheap labor on the hotels refurbishing stay away at all cost          ,negative,0,0,0,1
got an upgrade we arrived at this hotel in the small hours of the morning and were given a room on the 4th floor when we tried to get into the room the lock was on the door so my husband went down to reception to find out what was going on we were told that sometimes the locks do catch but that we would be given an upgrade to an executive room on the 12th floor room was large and had a king size bed bathroom not very big but adequate with plenty of towels hairdrier and cosmetics on the bed was a gauze bag with earplugs sleep mask and lavender linen spray we had breakfast in the dining room and both the buffet and the ala carte menu were good large servings and well cooked and presented the staff were very attentive and friendly also ate dinner there one night and thoroughly enjoyed it reception staff were very helpful when i needed to find a book shop even providing me with a map so i knew exactly where i was and how far the book shop would be i would recommend this hotel ,positive,0,4,0,4
awful this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in however it holds the hotel of the year award for 2001 for the chain but hey do not appear to have any clean bed sheets i found black hair and big yellow puddle stains on the sheets mattresses and comforters i requested to move rooms and the new room had the same problems housekeeping came and tried to clean the bed but had to open new sheets because the replacement sheets also had stains this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in based upon the quality of the bedroom what a disgusting hotel i checked out the same day ,negative,0,0,0,1
not rodeo drive but excellent stay this is a good hotel located a few blocks from rodeo drive  20 min walking with lots of facilities the room was very comfortable bed was great lots of pillows to choose spacious bathroom was good though a little bit old for la you have to have a car so the hotel is quite nice located the beverly drive has some shops and a lot of restaurants which are worth looking at you can walk to rodeo drive and take a cab back better than trying to find a parking place hotel has a garage about 16 dollar day free internet restaurant was ok but very dark and old we did not have breakfast there but they brew starbucks coffee there there is a supermermarket around the corner where coffee and fresh pastries bagels etc are available so best option for breakfast ,positive,3,3,0,4
not what you expect stayed at the crowne for 6 nights just because it is in beverly hills does not mean it is top of the line the rooms were very small the bathroom was rediculously small  take one step in turn around and sit on toilet step in shower or wash hands prison cells are bigger than this  staff was very pleasant and helpful bartender not very friendly plenty of sitting space in lounge and check in area we stayed on the 8th floor which included a small refrigerator  nice admenity  ,negative,3,0,0,2
comfortable hotel we stayed at the crowne plaza for 2 nights as part of a 4 week us honeymoon the travel agent recommended this hotel for a short stay the room was of a good size though the bathroom was absolutely tiny  i have found this across most of the us  only one person could be in there at a time the staff were friendly and helpful the lady at the little tour desk downstairs could not do enough to help us with booking our tour there was a lot of australians staying here which we really liked as we were really only in la for about 36 hours it was hard to tell if it was an ideal location or not but we enjoyed it while there we walked a couple of blocks to find quite a few restaurants down sth beverly boulevard and chose one of these to eat at the first night the second night we took a cab and managed to get into mortons for dinner and it was divine overall a good place for a short stay ,positive,3,3,0,4
great location perfect for the business traveler i was only in town for a short period but the crowne plaza really made my stay enjoyable the sleep kit complete with lavender spray ear plugs and eye mask were just the icing on the cake to a down comforter and pillows the only negative i have is the parking garage which is in need of some major sprucing up but my room view and total experience was wonderful ,positive,5,0,0,4
don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,negative,4,0,1,1
abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,negative,0,0,0,1
it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,negative,0,3,2,0
fantastic stay at the crown plaza beverly hills i have recently returned from a holiday in the united states and chose to stay at the crown plaza hotel in beverly hills for an initial period of five nights from the 23rd to 28th september 2007 due to some accommodation problems in new york i had to leave a few days earlier than i anticipated i contacted the crown plaza hotel and arranged two nights accommodation for the 16th  17th september so that i had somewhere to stay once i arrived in los angeles it also gave me time to try and organize for the five nights that i booked to be moved forward subject to availability from the moment i arrived at the hotel i was impressed with the level of service i arrived at approximately 11pm on the 16th september 2007 after flying from new york to los angeles i had not been able to access the internet at all while i was in new york  as i use broadband not wireless internet services and realized when i got to my room that it looked as though only wireless internet was offered i made a general enquiry with one of the staff who organized to send someone up to my room within 5 minutes i was advised that the hotel could still accommodate broadband internet access and would just need to hook up a cable given how late it was i advised the gentleman that i was happy enough to wait until the next morning to get things sorted out to my surprise he offered again to connect up the cabling which only took another few minutes stating that after arriving late that i might like to sleep in the next morning and the internet would be ready to access whenever i needed it the next day i was so grateful for this level of service particularly late at night i then noticed the sleep advantage pack on the bed after unpacking a few things i had a shower put the cd on a few drops of lavender on my pillow and got into what can only be described as the most comfortable bed that i have slept in while staying in a hotel i quite honestly thought i was in heaven what a fantastic idea especially for people either arriving at the hotel late and or after a long flight despite a lot of problems being caused through the company that i originally booked my accomodation through i did manage to stay the 5 additonal nights mostly due to efforts of two of the managers at the hotel mr cruz and mr page i cannot express my gratitude enough to them for their professionalism and genuine desire to ensure that i was able to stay the five nights that i had paid for and be able to continue my stay at the hotel the level of service offered by the staff at the crown plaza hotel continued to impress me the entire seven nights of my stay all the staff were friendly professional and couldn do enough to ensure that my stay at the hotel was the best that could possibly be offered i would not hesitate to stay at the crown plaza hotel again    i really had a fantastic stay here ,positive,0,0,0,4

expected more i stayed at this hotel for three nights based on reviews from tripadvisor after arriving on a 13 hour flight we just wanted to check in and sleep we were told our room would be ready in half an hour and they would let us know when it was ready we waited patiently in the foyer    two hours later i asked what was happening and was told oh sorry i forget to let you know  your room was ready over an hour ago exhausted and frustrated we finally made it to bed the room was nice  spacious and clean but the walls were paper thin and we were kept awake at 1am with television and converstation in the next room we could hear word for word what they were saying i am a priority club member and was given the free breakfast which was very good on the last day the concierge arranged for a town car to take us to the airport five minutes after booking he called our room to confirm that it was indeed booked when the town car never showed up we asked the bellman about it who asked somebody else who said oh yeah    he cancelled five minutes later we were told that it was never booked at all we were left to find our own way to the aiport the location is in the middle of nowhere i would not stay here again ,negative,0,4,0,2

a but shabby and not chic we stayed here for one night in december and i would have to say i would not stay here again we did get a good rate from lastminute so for the price i can t complain too much the lobby is nice enough but the wallpaper in the hallways is peeling there were dishes and plates all along the floor in the hallway the rooms were okay nothing special the hotel is located in an area that s off the beaten path there are restaurants in the hotel and down the road but i just didn t feel comfortable walking there at night with just my young son the staff was all nice enough no problem there we stayed at loews beverly hills around the corner a few weeks before and it was more expensive but much nicer ,negative,2,0,3,3
great hotel having read reviews about moderately priced hotels in la i was worried about reports of unsafe neighbourhoods unfriendly staff and dirty rooms  one reported dried blood on the bedhead  i chose the crowne plaza beverly hills because of generally positive tripadvisor reviews its location and access to good public transport and i was not disappointed i can thoroughly recommend this hotel the staff were friendly the rooms very clean and the beds were so comfortable i had trouble getting my daughter up in the mornings we joined the hotel chain s priority club and received a complimentary breakfast each morning which was more than adequate and saved us dollars the bathrooms were a little small and needed updating but they were fine there was easy access to the city bus system with the big blue busstop to santa monica beach just around the corner and the metro to downtown outside the front door we were in walking distance to rodeo drive we had no trouble getting around using the public transport system and enjoyed our stay in la and at the crowne plaza ,positive,4,3,4,4
totally disappointed i ve booked a room because of its name  crowne plaza but what i found was a terrible hotel the room was dirty and smelly i asked in the front desk for another room but they did not have one at that moment on my 3rd day the bathtub starts to flood i asked again for another room and what i got was another dirty and smelly room stained towels smelly pillows used bandaid in the floor   on the check out i have filled the guest survey but never had an answer for my complains   so   i would not stay here if someone paid me to ,negative,0,0,0,1

3 and a half our of 5 i would actually give this hotel a rating 3 and a half if i could overall the hotel is good  slightly above average but nothing spectacular  good value for money though the lobby could do with a redecoration but the rooms are grand  clean modern bright and spacious the staff and friendly and eager to please  we organised a tour to disneyland through them and had no problems we didn t want to drive in la so the location is out of the way from most tourist destination  apart from beverly hills obviously  but it was our choice not to drive so i wouldn t hold this against the hotel if you hired a car and were willing to put up with driving in la you d have no problems hotel is near bus routes to santa monica venice so this was good  although you always get weird looks when you ask how to go anywhere in la by public transport  it s just assumed you re looking for driving directions  on the otherhand the location was good in terms of being nice and quiet at night and away from the madness of hollywood etc also there are lots of good resturants near by within 15 mins walking distance and not that expensive for beverly hills definitely sign up for the priority club as this is what gets you the free breakfast  well worth it ,positive,3,0,4,4
great location nice hotel we stayed at the crowne plaza from august 27 to 31 location was great just 15 minutes walk from rodeo drive and 510 minutes to nice bards and restaurants not at all a bad location as a person mentioned we requested a room on high floor with nice view and got a room on 10 floor great view to downtown other side of the hotel  pool side would give view to beverly hills homes but we loved downtown side make sure you get a room on high floow otherwise you have vierw to next building only thing we missed is an inroom safe thius should be standard beds are great you also get a relaxation cd you can use in the rooms cd player and a nice linen spray bathrooms are averaged they need some modernization service was good staff always very helpful if you are priority club member  free membership make sure you sign in before you arrive you get free continental breakfast in lobby selection is limited but ok tried buffet breakfast once also fair price but if you have breakfast in the area its better there is a supermarket next block you can also get everything there pool area is nice during weekend they sometimes run out of towels and deckchairs during weekdays its ok if we go to los angeles again we devinitively will stay there again ,positive,4,4,4,4

disappointed after driving down from san francisco to la in early january 2004 we were expecting everything the crowne plaza however was disappointing the room was nice but cramped for two people the bed next to the bathroom just managed to allow the door to open but you could hear everything going on in the bathroom so not very private the water wouldn t drain whilst taking a shower so we stood in shampoo soap and conditioner until stepping out we called maintenance up who fixed it but the problem still occurred honestly we couldn t be bothered calling again the use of the internet downstairs in the lobby was good the nightlife on the strip on a thursday night was non existent and very disappointing venice beach fared better the following day ,negative,3,0,0,2

nice hotel great location we cannot fault the hotel as they were very helpful and accommodating  our flight from hawaii to la was cancelled therefore we missed our evening arrival at the hotel we were only booked in for one night en route to las vegas and were set to be charged anyway for room rate if we did not show we contacted them beforehand to explain and they kept our room for us to arrive at 8am following morning instead of the expected 8pm previous evening  they extended our checkout time so we could grab breakfast couple hours sleep and showers and enjoy the rest of the day in la before evening flight to vegas concierge were helpful efficient and the desk chatty making us feel welcome the overall feel of the place was welcoming nice relaxed bar area and our room on club floor was nice very clean and spacious we were on our honeymoon so they had given us a better room than rate paid location great for walking rodeo drive etc shame we did not have longer  rushed visit ,positive,4,3,4,4

if you are looking for upscale don t look here even though i was upgraded to a nice sized one bedroom suite  i was staying free on my priority club points this hotel that touts itself as a luxury hotel and believe me this hotel is not luxurious they have renovated recently so the public areas seem pleasant at first glance however when you take a closer look the public areas are very dirty and not well maintained there was gum stuck to the wall in the lobby all 3 days i was there filthy glass entrance doors trash on the elevator floors dirty carpet etc the room seemed pretty clean except for the hair all over the bathroom floor gross the room itself had some nice touches but overall felt like an older holiday inn trying to disguise itself as something nicer service was indifferent except for the great concierge was helpful also not very luxurious was having to go out the front lobby doors to get to the pool which is located next to the street the club lounge was your basic hotel room with a cheap continental breakfast convenient but nothing special valet was understaffed  just the one bellman on staff one evening i had to get the car myself from the garage because he was too busy crowne plaze also announced it s new luxurious beds the bed was nice because it was brand new but actually very firm and not high quality location is ok if you have a car but not too much around walking distance this hotel is fine for basic no frills accomodations if you get a good low rate i wish i hadn t used my points here tho kind of a waste i would have stayed at a nicer holidayinn express ,negative,3,3,2,2

pioneer square bw fine choice we chose bw pioneer square in seattle because it was the closest to the amtrak station and we had a one night layover between trains turns out it was a fine choice for other reasons too it s a charming old building at the epicenter of old seattle as the name implies my morning walk took me to pioneer square itself and to the seattle city hall both within three blocks the docks and puget sound are a block away and it s an easy walk to pike street market rooms are big and nicely renovated ours had a balcony on the street with a lovely view of a full moon though i know they can t always provide that the staff was friendly and knowledgable the free breakfast and free bowl of fruit welcome and good fine place mac nelson joyce haines ,positive,5,5,5,5
warm hospitality on a rainy seattle night we had just arrived in downtown seattle after debarking from the bremerton ferry during the evening rush hour negotiating traffic in the rain was somewhat nerveracking so when we entered the hotel lobby we probably looked bedraggled the desk clerk immediately assessed our mental state giving us a warm welcome and attending to the details of checking us in efficient order our room was wonderful combining modern amenities with pioneer square ambiance we will definitely be coming back to the pioneer square hotel ,positive,5,5,5,5
location is just one feature here we had four great days here recently  location is fantastic given that there is so much within walking distance  including stadia and railway station  and if it rains  which is does here transit is free in a large zone of downtown front desk staff could not have been more helpful and have a sense of humour the concierge knew the answers to the questions we had and the room was quiet and clean and comfortable we will return    ,positive,5,0,5,5

love the feeling of coming home we have called this hotel home for 34 nights once a year for the past five years the staff is wonderful the rooms are clean and the breakfast is great no views but we stay on the go so much that who cares you can walk to safeco for ballgames walk to pike market the art museum the library three book stores and you are right on the waterfront i recommend it highly and look forward to more stays ,positive,5,5,5,5
great hotel for a low price and fantastic location i stayed at the best western pioneer square for two nights last month and was very impressed it was close to safeco field and the other attractions in the area as well as the best continental breakfast i ve ever had at a hotel great selection and quality items to select from staff was friendly and helpful with directions and bus routes  one of the stops for the bus to from seatac is only a few blocks away  rooms were very clean and comfortable i didn t get any discounts on the room but it was still a great deal compared to what other hotels in downtown were charging ,positive,5,5,5,4

great location rooms were super clean with excellant mattress and pillows quiet accomadations with a lovely shower tub combination the continental breakfast had an extremely large variety of options and everything was temperature correct i would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in the area we stayed here because we were going on a cruise this location was very close to all downtown seattle sights and to the cruise line location parking garage was close by and well guarded ,positive,5,5,5,0
very disapointed my first time to the west coast and i had to pick this property very average all the way the way the noise level at night from my neighbors was way too loud the service was slow and the room had a funny smell the staff made me feel like an unwelcome visitor not a special guest no wifi service although they advertise there is this not a good best western  to bad seatle is very nice ab  ,negative,0,2,1,1
great location we stayed here for a girls trip in a standard double double the hotel is well located across from the ferry docks and within walking distance to public transportation the rooms are small and the view from our window was not great but the staff was wonderful and the continental breakfast in the morning with eggs yogurt oatmeal toast and muffins fruit etc filled us up we spent three nights here and had a wonderful time nice get away for singles or couples trips ,positive,5,4,3,4
very good stay we spent the first night of our pacific northwest northern ca trip at the pioneer square and were very happy the first room we were shown had a slightly odd arrangement where the tv was to the side of the bed and not easily viewable being from boston and on the road for the first night of the world series being able to view the tv was important to us at the front desk my request was easily and politely accomodated and we were given a more tv viewable room we found the location of the hotel particularly with the free public transport offered by seattle to be great the staff was very professional and helpful the only slight negative was the breakfast which we found to be pretty mediocre overall we were very happy with our hotel selection ,positive,5,2,4,5

great location but noisy we stayed at this hotel while in seattle on business check in was very complicated they had no parking available when we arrived and the front desk staff was not helpful at all with the parking situation our company was paying for the stay but when we arrived we had to wait 45 minutes for someone in the office to figure out what was going on when we arrived in our room we were plesantly surprised it was large very clean and comfortable the wireless internet left a lot to be desired very slow and constant drop offs in the evening the noise from the freeway nearby was constant  for the money that this establishment cost we could have stayed in a sheraton or hilton and been a lot happier  ,negative,4,0,1,1
great customer service but lacking in other areas   stayed at this place because i had a business meeting in downtown seattle this hotel is right in downtown seattle but is in the pioneer square area to me this area was pretty bad and i would walk around there alone  i am a woman  i would not feel safe there anyway the hotel is pretty nice and the customer service is first rate the room was very large but the bed was extremely uncomfortable great pillows but my body ached from sleeping in the very hard bed the shower was the best part big and plenty of hot water  i loved that part luckily i didn t have to pay for the room but it was pretty expensive  not worth the money to me and parking is a mess there  you have to park about 2 blocks away in this parking garage that is not run by the hotel it is very inconveinant     ,negative,2,0,1,5
no security in pioneer square we had a nice stay in seattle for two days in this hotel until the moment we were checking out we had noticed what appeared to be vagrants sitting in the unattended lobby a couple of times including the early morning were checking out my wife left our bags for a moment to get a muffin at the continental breakfast and when she came back to the bags her handbag was gone and so was the fellow who was sitting across from her i was at the counter checking out and didn t see anything but i did see the suspicious fellow sitting in the lobby as i move our bags the manager was not there as it was a sunday and they have treated us like we re trying to pull a scam they claim no liability for baggage untended but they should at least take responsibility for making sure their lobby is clear of derelicts waiting to prey on their customers from about 9 a m to 6 p m there is supposed to be someone at the front door but outside those hours they have nobody there and the clerks are unable to see who is coming in or leaving the manager says they have security cameras but i think she was bluffing to see if i backed off of our claims none of the other employees there that morning knew of any cameras furthermore the manager never returned any of my calls as promised we feel we ve been treated disrespectfully and none of our suggestions have been taken seriously  ie the need for fulltime frontdoor concierge security  that part of seattle has really become full of vagrants beware  ,negative,1,0,1,1
nice hotel but     very nice hotel well remodelled and tasteful accommodations staff was helpful polite and unobtrusive the major problem is the number and outright in your face quality of the derelicts that inhabit every street corner bench and doorway of the pioneer square area to be forced to watch so that you dont step in someones urine trail to have to turn your back so as to not have to watch a derelict urinate in broad daylight on the biulding on a main street to have to push one of them away from me when he kept circling back closer and closer to me is too much i will never stay in downtown seattle again well over a hundred dollars and you are a prisoner in your hotel the derelicts have taken over pioneer square they own their benches doorways and covered areas they own pioneer square wake up seattle and take your city back guess i will be staying at the airport nextime lots of good restaurants and shops that are loosing customers due to the prevalence of these derelicts ,negative,1,0,1,5

best downtown hotel having frequent business in the downtown seattle area i am always looking for good deals at better than average hotels and i have found the best one yet at the pioneer square hotel spotless property great staff and excellent location make this hotel a sure winner it is close enough to everything that downtown seattle has to offer from art to entertainment that i have never needed to take a cab anywhere the courteous and knowlegable staff gave me great and uptodate instructions on where to go for world class jazz  just around the corner this hotel really made my recent trips to seattle very special and enjoyable and i gladly highly recommend it to one and all ,positive,5,0,5,5
great price and excellent location my wife and i decided to visit seattle for the first time and booked the pioneer square hotel online when we arrived the staff was perfect they noticed we were from out of town and offered to point out great spots to hit while we were here and even made us reservations for salty s seafood restaurant all at check in  the room was perfect overlooking the street and breakfast was great we paid 143 per night and that was great compared to other hotels we looked at i will definatley be sending my friends here ,positive,5,5,5,5
what a great hotel don t understand the complaints on this website about this hotel we stayed here for two nights in late august and loved everything about it first the location was great it was within walking distance of both the waterfront and pike place market and we could easily take the monorail to the space needle  there are hills in seattle so if you have someone with you who has trouble walking you may want to consider taking a bus or taxi  both the lobby and the room were nicely decorated and the staff was very helpful being on pioneer square meant that we could go next door or right across the street to get a drink and or something to eat of course we didn t walk through the square at night because of the street people who hung out there but that s just common sense we were never bothered by anyone and because this hotel is so well located we were able to easily enjoy this great city if you re worried about street noise call the hotel directly and ask for an interior room we had an interior king and it was very quiet we plan to return to seattle and when we do we ll stay at the best western pioneer square hotel again ,positive,5,0,5,5
it was  ok we stayed here sunday august 21st our reservation was made online base rate of 158 directly with the hotel upon checkin they indicated they were upgrading our room to a deluxe we were on the 4th floor with a small balcony the room was clean and adequate nothing special this is an old hotel in a district that i would not feel comfortable walking in the late hours breakfast was continental apathetic staff probably would not stay there again ,negative,0,3,4,1
lack of customer service skills and overpriced we found this place online and made a reservation through third party booking like many we were just staying one night and sharing the room with friends when we arrived we were politely greeted our reservation was for 4 persons per our confirmation letter when they asked how many guests we told them 4 and they said that the extra guest cost was 20 00 for each person per night our rate was already over 150 00 for a room with 2 double beds we told them that our reservation was for 4 persons and they said their system said 2 persons we went ahead and took the room at this time nobody told us anything about parking and we had to ask we were then given a key for the garage and told it would be 50 if we lost the key and 100 on sunday if we left it in the car because the garage is closed on sundays nothing more was said about parking we left and went to the ball game returning late in the evening we received our keys and went to the extremely small room we walked in and it had a view of the brick building next door the room was very clean when we checked out the next morning we asked again about the rate and produced the confirmation letter we were told that we were getting the best rate available and that we would have to take it up with the third party booking company we then questioned the charge for the parking we were never told about the 18 00 to park in the garage we told them such and were told he was the manager and insisted that the person checking us in told us we told him that he had checked us in and that he only told us about the key charged for the garage and never the parking amount he then told us that he always tells guests and that he was the manager he would not work with us at all on the price even though we were never told about the parking fee or that our confirmation letter showed 4 persons so in turn we ended up paying 240 00 for a room that you could find at any budget motel the breakfast leaves something to be desired the floor was filthy with food and the food was not well stocked counters were dirty and the staff was sitting behind the counter talking we walked up to the corner tullys instead i would never stay at this motel again having worked for hotels for the past 7 years i do not know how they keep guests if we treated a guest as they had we would be out of business i would recommend customer service training we will never stay there again and we will tell many people about our experience this is definately not what we expected from a best western we gave it a 2 because it was clean ,negative,0,1,1,1
the customer is not always right at the pioneer square it was a sunday night in april and we were in town for a concert and after the evening crew gave a great effort physically showing us a few of the different rooms  which were some of the smallest i ve ever seen with views of backend brick walls  they led us to believe when we asked about parking that we could either park on the street at no charge that night or park in the garage a block up the road when we were thinking about getting a parking pass to save hassle for later they simply said talk to the night shift when you get back and they will set you up after coming back that night a young man was working who claimed he was new and got his manager when we asked about the parking when we asked for the parking pass he wanted 15 and we refused telling him we were led to believe by the conversation with the evening shift that it was free the manager told us that that wasn t his policy as he pulled out his hotel policy book and that we either had to pay the 15 or park on the street which started on the meter at 7 am this was great news coming at 1 am and exhausted we felt cheated in an obvious bluff attempt he then proceeded to tell us that he would check the video tape  as he told us everything was recorded throughout the day and if we weren t told about the charge he would give us our pass at no charge when i accepted the offer staring him in the face he then proceeded to go back on his offer and again refused to offer the pass running in circles you mean they didn t give you the pass yet excuse me what if i had the pass already i would have been in a parking lot parking my car and not in the middle of an argument about paying it we had only been there checked in hours earlier and told the manager that we wanted our money back and would go find another hotel in that case he refused he would not refund us our money and we were forced to stay there that night it was late we were tired and he was running in circles with his lame arguments we decided to wake up at 7 am pay the meter for a couple more hours and leave i wasn t giving this place another dollar the next day we found another hotel near the space needle and were treated with the utmost respect and in subsequent visits will never stay at that dive again the only good thing and the reason i gave a 2 and not a 1 was the one bellhop that showed us the small rooms and helped us with the door that would never swipe and really helped us out the place is a nice location but based on this experience the lack of management skills and others that i read that had the same parking problem there are other hotels and i would pass on the pioneer square best western ,negative,4,0,0,2

a really good choice  when returning from hawaii we stopped at seattle in this hotel and we didn t regret it we arrived in the very morning  10am and settled in our room immediatly and we really did appreciate that the room was big king size bed and comfortable bathroom very enjoyable too room was also very calm the lift gives you a view on the different levels thanks to glass transparency which was very nice because we were in seattle just for the snow storm location is very good too  space needle and downtown are at a walkable distance  breakfast is complementary and very good spa fitness room and sauna are also available for free a really good choice for the price  80  ,positive,4,4,4,4
stay away    not worth it   dirty run down smelly and bad location wanted to stay in the downtown area am a member of the best western gold club and decided to add some points to my balance and stay here we are not super picky  we just need a bed after all since we will be out and about most of the day anyway it was difficult to find rest and comfort at this location besides the horrible noise pollution going on outside the guests in the hotel do not care about being quiet at 2am either  and the staff could care less the room was dingy if not out right dirty smelled like mildew and had stains on the carpet tiny bathroom not big enough to turn around in bad tv reception just to add insult to injury walls and lines felt damp  humid area but why would that matter indoors location is much to be desired homeless people sleeping next to the hotel and i think i actually witness a drug deal going on outside my window    pay a few extra  and stay somewhere safer cleaner and more comfortable ,negative,1,0,1,1
unhappy customer i am employed at a best western and i was dissappointed with our experience at the loyal inn 1 the staff was very nice the room was clean but  2 we were very disappointed at the size of our room for five people having requested a room with double queen beds we got what seemed like standard size double beds  room  210 3 the parking   we were very shocked and disappointed to have to have paid 10 00 plus 1 65 parking tax to park our car at the motel we paid over 100 00 to stay in  4 the spa was very grossly dirty  we wouldn t even get in it after seeing the slim and hair ring all around it we will not recommend staying at this motel to anyone and we will never stay there again debbie dreyer  ,negative,0,0,1,1
don t believe all the reviews   my husband and i stayed at this hotel pre and postcruise i read some reviews of the hotel after we had booked and wondered just what kind of place we were going to because some of the reviews were pretty awful i must say that our experience was just great  yes it does have a small lobby but it is clean and comfortable and the staff while young went out of their way to make us comfortable and get us in a room as quickly as they could our rooms were very clean and we had no problems with noise or disturbances from other guests my husband accidentally left our entire camera case in the taxi that took us to the hotel and three different shifts of desk clerks made calls on our behalf trying to get it back for us i am pleased to say that a wonderful cab driver brought it to us on his day off and got it to us with just minutes to spare before we left for the pier yes the hotel is in a somewhat transitional neighborhood but no one bothered us and if you want a great breakfast  at any time of the day take a minute and walk about a block to the hurricane cafe they have great food at pretty reasonable prices i would stay at this hotel again ,positive,5,4,4,4
horrible and annoying be careful if you are about to book this hotel the room is ok but the location is not and we were bothered by some people who always complained to the front desk that the noise of our room was too annoying maybe it was just some people here who were not friendly but you can notice that the front desk here is quite offish and unfriendly too the first night we set the volume to normal level according to our experience at other hotels  san francisco and other places right before we came here  and somebody called front desk to complain about the noise alright we then made the sound as unnoticeable as possible but that guy knocked on the wall heavily when we were about to sleep and the tv was off next day we adjusted the volume bar to only one fifth of the bar but that guy was still complaining by calling the front desk and knocking on our wall what s wrong with watching tv at 9pm with just a little sound maybe the wall is paper thinthe front desk should come up to solve the problem and i actually asked the front desk to do so however he was really offish and unhelpful really annoying and horrible experience don t come if you wanna have a good mood while traveling ,negative,1,0,2,1
disappointing weekend at best western loyal inn seattle this hotel is on the seedy edge of seattle check in was ok and the desk clerk was helpful with planning a city tour upon entering the room my friend and i were barely able to wend our way between the overlarge pieces of furniture and beds the opening to the dressing room closet vanity area was less than 23 located directly off of the entry area to the room there were a total of nine lamps and wall fixtures of which only 2 could be lighted they offer a nice breakfast included in the price of the room but the eating area becomes quite messy as the morning passes there seemed to be a shortage of staff at least while we were there it was a big football game weekend and the hotel was at full occupancy the bed linens were said to be new but the mattress and box springs were very worn and shabby the color scheme of the draperies upholstery and bedding was disconcerting we wrote a letter to the corporate headquarters detailing our dissatisfaction and received a quasi form letter explaining that they are in the process of redecorating some rooms so the rooms might have had both old and new furniture in them no other excuse was given for the lighting problems this particular room should really not have been offered to guests usually best western has been quite satisfactory but this occasion was not up to their advertised standards ,negative,0,0,0,4
ok for the price but look elsewhere the hotel was ok a little run down with average cleanliness but we chose it for price as seattle is quite expensive we didn t get the room bed that we reserved and the staff was unhelpful best westerns used to always have nice hotels but this one doesn t fit that mold we ll choose a different hotel probably more expensive the next time we visit seattle ,negative,0,0,3,1
dingy and dank don t be fooled by the other reviews they must be written by the ownership this hotel is gross every fabric surface of the interior was stained the beds were totally uncomfortable at first i thought they had me sleeping directly on the box spring mattress kids rented a room across the hall and were smoking marijuana outside my door the smoke came into my room seriously i complained but they didn t kick the kids out for several hours there were bums climbing in the garbage cans outside the hotel i selected the hotel because it was reasonably priced and close to the downtown and space needle guess what it ain t that close you re still about 12 blocks from the main downtown attractions and about 6 blocks from the space needle i took a cab downtown if your looking to save money i would suggest that you stay at hotel further away from the downtown area or pony up the extra bucks a night and stay at someplace decent seriously this is not a joke i live in east oakland california so i know what bad conditions are and this place reminded me of a cheap rent by the hour motel ,negative,2,0,1,1
great value great customer service i usually stay at 4  5 star hotels but decided to try this best western given its positive reviews location and good price i was very impressed with the friendly  helpful front desk staff the functionality and cleanliness of the room the great location and the free breakfast in the mornings the room was sparsely decorated very simple but always clean with a safe that fits a laptop a small fridge and a microwave that is great for leftovers there is a good sushi place across the street it s not luxurious by any stretch but well worth the money i would definitely stay here again if i was on a budget ,positive,5,4,5,5

a lot of bang for the buck very good value location amenities i m a repeat customer of the bw loyal booked via  com when the internet price had dropped between my online booking and arrival i telephoned and jacob honored the lower price also used that advance phone call to verify 2 people with lots of luggage needed two beds all rooms are nonsmoking our clean room 422 was on the quiet  er side of the building facing the alley and not denny way it was average size had 2 upholstered chairs 1 square table 2 luggage racks the compact flourescent bulbs in the 3 lamps gave off more than adequate bright white light bathroom sink in alcove separate from room with tub toilet continental breakfast free local calls free local shuttle jacuzzi on bus line great location north of  and away from the downtown skyscrapers gives a sense of breathing room with the city park across the street my previous stay nov 05 was in a kingsize room with wetbar refrig mw for well under 100 night in the offseason when their nicer rooms are certainly available this bw loyal is my choice over anything priceline has ever put me in and there is now a whole foods  market a block away  ,positive,5,4,4,4
you get what you pay for keep the subject line in mind when thinking about booking this hotel i hope other people have had great experiences as seattle is so great but that was not my experience i booked a non smoking room because yes us difficult californians don t like the smell of smoke my room reaked of smoke obviously the people who stayed there before probably smoked in the room every day the manager although understanding said we can t control that and we have no other room to give you  which was true in august in seattle  the next day the electric on one wall went out and i was left with no reading lights i was informed that there was nothing they could do about this until monday but on sunday the lights did come back on yes they did give me a small discount but that was not the point when i go to a city a don t want to have conflict regarding my room the kids at the front desk were very nice but they didn t know what to do anyway not all best westerns are bad but it really depends on the individual owner if you have the money stay at the westins as they offer a very consistent level of room and service this makes your stay so much nicer i ve learned my lesson ,negative,0,0,3,3
very impressed would stay again rooms are simple but comfortable who cares if it s a bit dated it s excellent value for money very close to down town space needle and loads of great restaurants breakfast is good and the staff are exceptional and very helpful free wireless internet in room newspaper parking etc etc it s very good value will definitely stay here again if in seattle ,positive,4,0,5,4
deceptive staff deceptive front desk staff claiming you cannot park on the street between 10pm and 4am    in order to try and get you to pay the 15 parking fee with them this is completely not true parking is free in seattle on the street between 6pm and 8am they even put deceptive signage on the outside of the building facing the street saying no parking between 10pm and 4am   but this is wrong it is a public street and falls under the same seattle bylaws locals seem to know this and park there anyway to go to a nearby latenight club anyway save your money and park on the street  plenty of free space in this area  or stay at the travel lodge next door which offers free parking as for room   the organic fresh odor neutralizer stuff they use is nauseously overpowering any attempts by them to be ecofriendly were lost on us as we had to blast the heat with the window wide open in order to try and aerate the room other than that only minor complaints it sucks that the room key is one big advertisement for some pizza company and that there is advertising and overbearing signage in the room but i guess this is to be expected for a major chain ,negative,0,0,1,1
couldn t wait to leave i stayed there in september the bed was hard as a rock it was like sleeping on planks of wood the only saving grace is that my room had a lovely view of the space needle i prebooked and paid for two nights but was so fedup and disappointed that i left a day early they wouldn t give me my money back for the unused second night they said that i would have to do that when i returned back to australia i was also disappointed and extremely surprised that they didn t have room service ,negative,4,0,1,1
never stay again tired looking hotel and room dirty towel in bathroom when we checked in room did not smell fresh dirty dish left on the floor in the hall across from our room for the 3 days we were there male desk clerk not friendly we asked if there was any family restaurants near the hotel and he rudely said a pizza place down the street and the hotel restaurant the next day we found a mcdonalds on the next street and many more restaurants 2 streets over 100 non smoking hotel but people in rooms near our room smoking marijuanna and the stink was everywhere i have chronic asthma and 3 small children and this was not acceptable by any standards we paid with hotel parking about 550 00 canadian dollars for 2 nights way overpriced for what we got we will never stay there again and we travel internationally on a regular basis so are very aware of good hotels that are out there ,negative,0,0,1,1
not impressed unfriendly staff when i checked in i asked for a higher floor  well the 3rd floor was the highest  but the lady at the front desk told me that she could only provide me this particular room on the second floor  i used my aaa rate so i guess you are restricted only on certain block of rooms that s fine but when i got in the room the place was smelling so badly of food perhaps from the previous guest so the windows were wide open obviously to get rid of the smell needless to say it was freezing and damp since it was still raining  it was in early june  i checked back downstairs and complained she still hesitated to move me to another room extremely unfriendly staff breakfast was ok and i heard a guest comment that he had been staying there for years butthat the hotel had really gone downhill in terms of standards the hallways could use a bit of an uplift and should be cleaned i will not recommend this hotel at all the only good thing is that they use environmental friendly products in their bathrooms ,negative,1,0,2,1

what a view i was pleasantly surprised by this best western which i tend to think of as a fairly budget chain this best western is really an exceptionfantastic view of the space needle from my window spacious and exceedingly clean rooms warm and responsive desk staff plus the committment to greensuites is impressive it s a few blocks away from belltown so there isn t much happening in the immediate vicinity except for construction seems kind of deserted at night so i don t know if i d walk around there alone at night but hey it s seattle and people drive ,positive,5,0,5,5
be aware   worst hotel ever i booked this hotel because of the good reviews on this site but this was a bad mistake i cannot understand how this hotel got such good reviews i ve been in may hotels all around the world but this was really one of the worst they could not find my reservation altought the rooms are clean the hotel is 80ies style and obviously was not renovated since then the windows in my room were so leaky that you could hear people talking and the traffic the whole night long another sideeffect it got terribly cold at night the heater  from the 80ies as well  could not really solve the problem never again ,negative,4,0,1,1
no respect for teenagers my son arrived only to find that they would not rent a room to him just because he did not hold a credit card even though he had permission to use his parents and we called to verify we were told this could only be arranged during office hours it was now late office hours were over i would have thought that the manager could make the decision but he told me no they had nowhere else to go the manager suggested a grungy hotel down the road they had cash and our credit card and we even talked to the manager but he told us he could not make any exceptions as this would be discrimination i think that it is discrimination to the teenagers as they would not rent to them with our approval written or verbal i can make purchases online but somehow i could not even place my credit card as security for the price of the room and other expenses some policies are too strict and some exceptions should always be allowed i spoke to best western head office and they told me that all best westerns were individually owned and operated therefore the policy was only with this one hotel so why couldn t the rule be bent a little it wasn t alot to ask for let the decent kids have a good place to stay no you treat them like scum and you wonder why our kids are the way they are today wow         so if you decide to stay here beware of policies ,negative,0,0,1,1
would definitely stay again we loved this hotel room was spacious and clean with a super comfortable bed extremely friendly and helpful staff monorail is only a block away  right beside the space needle  a round trip ticket is only 4 and besides just being plain cool it takes you directly to the downtown shopping district so if you want you can leave your car at the hotel for the day fantastic mexican restaurant azteca about a 5minute drive away excellent breakfast at the 5 point cafe just a couple blocks away   best pancakes i ve ever eaten we had a striking view of the space needle right outside our window which was pretty neat if you re in seattle to tour they also have a huge selection of tourist brochures for various activities in their lobby which is very handy all in all we had an excellent experience here and will definitely be staying here again on our next visit to seattle ,positive,4,0,4,5

okay to stay though amneities stank booked this hotel through travelocity because it was close to the space needle and had a restaurant the restaurant should be avoided at all costs  food is overpriced and despite my waitress s best intentions almost inedible first night there we ate dinner i ordered steak and shrimp for almost 19 only to receive a dry over cooked tiny piece of meat and two shrimp tried getting roomservice the next day for breakfast was informed they do not serve room service on weekends room was clean but was nonsmoking and smelled like cigarettes wouldn t stay there again ,negative,4,1,1,1

our first year staying at best westerns this year on our vacation we stayed at 3 different bw locations we were pleased with all of them at the executive we booked an upgraded room and were satisfied with everything even if it was a little expensive the room had a couch chair  footstool fridge microwave king size bed and a few touches that made it a little more luxurious than average we had a great view of the space needle and we took the monorail down to pike place market and walked around the waterfront and pioneer square glad we didn t have to drive in seattle as that alone could have ruined our visit this hotel was cheaper than one on the waterfront or right in the downtown business district and the monorail or the free zone for the bus make getting around easy we actually like to walk so did that except for the mono back and forth from the space needle the front desk gave us directions to the ferry for our trip to the olympic penisula and were in general courteous and helpful all in all we d stay here again if we ever return to seattle ,positive,5,0,4,5

grace inn i attended a conference at the best western grace inn and conference center at ahwatukee in phonix last week first the good parts   the public areas at the hotel were really quite nice and the conference rooms had the unique feature of opening on to the pool patio area with absolutely fabulous weather we had those doors open all day and night and it was such a nice departure from the usual closed in conference atmosphere the pool area was quite nice and it looked like the restroom in the lobby had been recently remodeled now for the not so good   the rooms needed some updating badly it was a sparcely furnished huge room with a flat planklike bed a small sofa and a chair a desk and a tv cabinet and even with all of that in there the place seemed cavernously empty old old drapes and bedspread and in that whole humongous room one teeny little picture on the wall made it look uncomfortably spartan the whole room slanted towards one wall and one morning when i opened up my drapes a bit past the window i found a huge crack in the wall seems like the whole place is on it s way to toppling my friends had a room that slanted even more than mine   one of them had trouble staying on her bed without sliding out another friend had a shower head that was hanging off the wall on arrival the main elevators in the lobby weren t working and it took most of the next day for them to be fixed   so we had to use the freight elevator to get our stuff up to our rooms the restaurant takes the prize for the world s worst breakfast buffet and service one morning i sat there for 20 minutes and no one even came around for a drink order no coffee   thank heavens i was able to scrounge some up at the conference if you re attending a conference there really isn t too much in the way of lodging close by   there s a hotel accross the highway but it s a very busy highway sort of like a freeway actually so it wouldn t really be convenient to stay elsewhere there are however several restaurants within walking distance if it s not your vacation you can tough it out for a couple of nights for a conference   but if you re considering this place for a vacation  i d stay elsewhere ,negative,0,1,2,0
pay extra and stay somewhere else this has to be the worst hotel i have ever stayed in and i was there 20 days on business needless to say i didnt pay for it their was no hot water the beds are very hard the staff was unfriendly no wifi only in the hotel lobby if you get a suite with a stove dont except dishes pots and pans they do not provide them you have to buy your own pay the 20 extra and stay somewhere s else  ,negative,0,0,1,1
convenient location but hotel is terrible my trip was paid for in advance and they charged me a second time i have been trying to get a refund for over 2 weeks now and they are nonresponsive no internet access except for a kiosk in the lobby which i found shocking considering even the super 8 offered free wireless the last time we stayed there rooms were on the dumpy side and the hallways and elevator screamed run down the pictures on the website are deceptive  it is not look that glamorous or elegant ,negative,4,0,1,1
not a 3 star i don t know how this hotel received a 3 star rating needs to be updated the shower head was hanging off the wall under the bathroom sink where another metal pipe should have been was a rubber pipe like one would use in your car the a c didn t work properly and neither did the bath water it would go from cold to scalding hot and vice versa the hotel was in an excellent part of town but i don t recommend it and will never stay there again i should have known better when i read that it used to be a best western the beds aren t comfortable either luckily we weren t at the hotel a lot so that helped ,negative,5,0,1,0

well below average i was looking for an aboveaverage traveler s hotel for a onenight stay unfortunately this is below average rooms are large but very plain with furnishings and fixtures as cheap as possible the hotel shows its age and badly needs refurbishing bathroom sink was on a slight slant because it was pulling out of the wall nothing is especially terrible or unacceptable about this hotel it is just subpar ,negative,0,0,1,0
great location this hotel is in a great location right off of i10 but the best part is its proximity to south mountain  only a few minutes drive from the hotel to the parking area at the mountain or you could walk it if you don t mind the busy streets if you plan to do any hiking this is a perfect place to stay there are also lots of restaurants to choose from nearby and right across i10 in tempe the rooms are large but need renovation although they are clean and it s well worth the 72 we paid  especially considering that it was march in phoenix usually a really expensive time the maids were efficient and unobtrusive the restaurant staff was courteous and attentive definitely the place to stay if you aren t looking for a resorttype hotel ,positive,4,0,4,4
highly recommend highlights resort grounds are a private oasis from the city of phoenix  staff is outstanding spa is the best we ve experienced  ever food and drinks at t cooks and the pool bar are top notchthis is our 3rd trip to the royal palms and we couldn t be more pleased i can t express how incredible the spa staff is we ve tried massages facials body wraps manicures and pedicures and have been thrilled with every one of them the staff at the pool  rick and jose make everyone feel like family we loved the bed so much we bought the mattress for our bedroom of all the places we ve been we d recommend this most highly ,positive,0,5,5,5
not worth all the praise   i booked this hotel for a romantic getaway after reading all the fabulous reviews on trip advisor however the visit was not half of what i expected i booked one of the casita rooms and while the bathroom was excellent the rest of the room was dark dusty and not particularly appealing to make things worse there were black bugs all over the room  rolipolis i am not sure if they have a more technical name  the night we checked in there was nothing we could do about it except hope for the best the second night the staff sprayed the room however the bugs remained and they had to come back in the next few days as well not what i would expect from such a pricey and wellrated venue nothing was done to compensate us for this continuously unpleasant experience additionally the reception staff and restaurant wait staff as mentioned by another reviewer was not particularly friendly or helpful they did not recommend restaurants excursion trips or anything that would be useful for one first visit to pheonix we were also charged 70 for minibar items that we did not use i had to call the hotel once i saw my credit card bill to have the charges reversed to be honest the only service i was really happy with was the valet service the pool was ok aysmall and felt more like a backyard pool than one of a hotel resort the rest of the grounds are very lovely nice flowers and architecture but other than that i found nothing exceptional or redeeming about the royal palsm there are many amazing hotel options in pheonix when i return it will definitely not be to this venue ,negative,3,0,2,3
royal palms is a rare gem my husband and i stayed 3 nights at this charming resort earlier this week having read the previous posts by other travellers we did have high expectations all of which were exceeded the spanish moorish designed space was full of hidden spots for enjoying the mountain views or stolen kisses fire pits with cozy cushions made it delightful to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful views and weather in the evening we enjoyed a wonderful dinner at t cooks one evening another evening we ventured out to the barrio cafe for authentic mexican food the best i have ever had  8 minute taxi ride  highy recommended ,positive,5,5,5,0
loved the place loved the staff the place was right on from the moment we pulled up iced water helpful valet staff room beyond expecations good  how rare is that  quiet ac huge bath that you can watch tv from and even a little terrace these people working here busted their butts to help you even in 105 degree heat nothing was too much trouble a tiny problem with the spa  our tai chi person didnt show  was met with a very generous offer of a great lunch and very reassuring apologies we felt they really did care about it great pool  not huge though  good location with a maze of paths even the places staff recommended were spot on main restaurant menu a little limited and the in room snacks  as usual very poor value but hey we re splitting hairs you guys girls at this place do a fabulous job we were very sad to leave after 4 days many thanks again  ,positive,5,3,3,5

a little disappointing   we stayed at the royal palms resort over father s day weekend and left with mixed emotions we booked a standard room and while it was clean and nicely appointed it was quite small the bath tub was ridiculous an older person would have found it unuseable we almost needed a step stool to get into it we found the concierge to be helpful enough but the front desk attendant seemed to have a forced smile and never mailed our postcards  after offering to do so  we had a delicious dinner at t cook s our table was disappointing though it was right next to the kitchen even though we had made the reservation months in advance and were obviously hotel guests on a brighter note our food server could not have been more attentive and gracious the grounds of the royal palms are pretty and the valet attendants were very speedy and pleasant however we have stayed at many other four and five star resorts in the phoenix scottsdale area and would probably not return to royal palms we have found much better service value and accomodations at the sanctuary and the phoenician ,negative,0,3,0,4
what a wonderful relaxing place just fantasitc i was looking for a place to stay by myself and i had read that this was a great place for couples i had a wonderful time and everyone there treated me like royality from the moment you walk in you a taken to another place i didn t feel like i was in arizona more like the meditterean the staff and spa were top notch take advantage of the yoga and culinary classes which are included in you resort fees next time i might come back with my husband i just loved it ,positive,0,0,5,5
wonderful resort my husband and i just came back from a wonderful 2 night 3 day stay at royal palms we had a spa room which was absolutly wonderful the bed was comfortable and the steam shower was a great touch rick and jose at the pool were exceptional the resort was booked that weekend but you would not have known there were plently of seats open at the pool and we had no problem getting into the resturant our room services came extremely quick and the food exceeded expectations i would recommend this resort to anyone looking to get away and have a nice relaxing vacation my husband and i travel a lot and this is one of the best places we have ever stayed ,positive,0,5,0,5
beautiful hotel but probably not for families just returned from a three night stay i did not select this hotel as we were with a group for a wedding our rooms were 567 per night with a 22 00 resort fee to cover gratuities very high i felt the grounds of the resort are amazing lush with lots and lots of flowers we stayed in two casitas connecting with king beds which were perfect away from the main hotel with nice courtyards in front to enjoy breakfast ours had a small water fountain also the rooms were above average with nice beds and comfortable furnishings one room had a fireplace although not cool enough outside to use it the bathroom was just ok all the staff were courteous and helpful questions were answered immediately especially room service i requested several special dishes with no problem i would recommend this resort to others even though i had a slight issue with jose by the pool on our first morning to the resort we took our two children  5  9 to the pool we were out early probably by 930 that morning the pool area had a few guests already but not many my children had only been in the pool a few minutes when jose approached me to tell me my children had to quote not yell horseplay jump splash or play marco polo in the pool and that he was just telling me before he got complaints i was shocked i ve never been told this before at any other resort from westin hyatt ritz carlton or four seasons i said i would tell them but they are children and they may make noise needless to say we didn t stay long by the pool i was not told at check in there were restrictions on children using the pool so i was confused by this comment by jose the next day i checked with the front desk and they did not know why jose would tell us that and that children are allowed in the pool area as long as they are accompanied by an adult the managerhillary did leave me a nice message in our room apologizing for this but we never did get an answer as to why we were told this that same day we spent several hours by the pool and there were other children jumping and splashing all over the pool so i really don t understand why jose told us this while i would recommend this resort i would probably choose a different hotel if we return with our children it s a great place for adults and my husband and i would stay here again but without our children ,positive,5,5,5,5

quiet  beautiful quiet elegant place to stay in scottsdale this former mansion turned resort is a lovely hideaway made for gentle relaxation my husband and i enjoyed one quiet night here with spa treatments in the morning the staff are very attentive but not annoyingly so there s a sense of them knowing what it takes to please high maintenance folks indeed i would definitely recommend this for couples  and probably older ones at that  not a lot on offer for those in search of nightlife  the royal palms lived up to the billing it gets here on tripadvisor ,positive,0,0,5,5
nice place we stayed here for four nights in february we reserved a deluxe casita and were pleased with the room it was a little smaller than we expected but certainly cozy it is an old resort but they have done well at maintaining the rooms and the amenities the grounds were meticulously maintained and staff was very pleasant the restaurant t cooks was very good the atmosphere was lively but quiet   busy but comfortable we recommend the espresso martinis after dinner instead of coffee   but be careful   after the caffeine wares off   you might find yourself crawling to your room all in all a nice experience ,positive,0,4,4,4

perfection i don t know where to start this hotel is simply spectactular i was a guest at the hotel in june 2007 traveling to arizona to attend a wedding i first took a quick side trip to tucson to visit friends and stayed at the arizona inn there how disappointing beautiful grounds great pool but the room was mediocre a bit tattered and worn and overall did not measure up to the positive reviews i saw on tripadvisor and which prompted me to book my stay there so my expectations were relatively muted when i made my way to phoenix and royal palms on entering the property i was blown away by the stunning architecture and gardening in the reservation desk area they had a pitcher of tasty and refreshing pink lemonade  lord knows it was certainly hot  and i was greeted warmly by the reservation agent here s where things started to get real good traveling in the offseason i thought i d secured a pretty good deal  i believe it was 150 night for one of their basic rooms well without even asking i was upgraded to one of the new spa suite rooms when the bellboy took me to my room and opened the door i almost fainted it was stunning on entering the room the sounds of soothing acoustic music enveloped you the lighting was just right dim and romantic the first part of the room is a sitting area with a luxurious turkishlike seatte full of comfy pilows  across from that you had an impressive entertainment unit and a small wet bar area in the center of the room was the most luxurious bath i ve ever had the privilege of looking at let alone using deep soaking tub those bowl sinks that sit on top of the the vanity a walkin steam shower lotions shower gels shampoo and conditioners that were heavenly you then enter the bedroom and it was the most comfortable bed i ve ever slept on just gorgeous dark stained wood floors two plasma tvs  one in the sitting area another in the bedroom  and to top it off a beautiful balcony that looked over a stunning courtyard area one afternoon we were serenaded by a spanish guitartist pinch me  i must be dreaming  unfortunately it was so daggone hot i couldn t really take advantage of the balcony also because i was running around a bit for wedding activities a long day trip to the grand canyon and the police concert the monday before i left i really didn t get to enjoy the room for my 4 night stay as much as i would have liked but that just gives me an excuse to make a return trip  during a better cooler  time of the year oh  and service talk about going the extra mile i discovered that my credit card was missing from my purse i couldn t find it anywhere i wasn t sure if i d dropped it while shopping or possibly in the car well one of the valets did a painstaking search throughout my rental car and managed to find the card in a really obscure location i guess it had fallen out of my purse while i was driving i was so grateful for the time and effort this gentleman put into finding the lost item overall service was exemplary throughout my stay royal palms has spoiled me for life when it comes to hotel accomodations i doubt there is a place that will ever measure up to my experience last summer the surprise factor alone of getting such a beautiful room at a fraction of it s normal nightly rate is something i ll likely never experience again in a nutshell royal palms is simply amazing  or as one of my good friends likes to put it all that and a bag of chips   you won t be disappointed   ,positive,5,5,5,5
royal palms is royal in every way we ve been to royal palms resort 3 times now and i can t imagine staying anywhere else in the phoenix area i was there once with my daughter for her college spring break for the ladies fling once with my husband for our anniversary and once as a family this resort was great for all of these vacations it is small which is a refreshing change from staying at huge hotels it was pricey but worth saving up for we were treated like royalty i liked the resort fee concept which relieved us of having to worry about tipping the staff everyone working there seemed to truely enjoy their jobs the rooms were luxurous in a tasteful comfortable way and we could enjoy our mornings and evenings on the patio right outside our room the grounds and pool were gorgeous if i had to find something that wasn t perfect it would be that they were short of pool chairs during peek swimming times and some guests would stake them out for the entire day however when we were at the pool we felt like we were really on vacation sipping our drinks delivered to us poolside the spa was awesome and dining at the restaurant was truely a gourmet experience staying at the royal palms is magical ,positive,5,5,5,5
a really top class resort stayed here just one night for a quick spa break with a girlfriend the sales representative on the phone convinced me with her attitude and friendliness that this would be a good place for me and my friend who was going through a tough time emotionally it offers a great luxury alternative to big chain spa hotels it is in a beautiful historic setting that creates a much more intimate ambience i would go back with my husband for a romantic weekend definitely it was beautiful relaxing and the service was excellent our room was huge and although it overlooked the parking lot still had a nice view and was extremely comfortable the beds were great the bathtub was the size of a swimming pool the grounds are absolutely lovely and worth strolling round the staff are really wonderful everyone knew our names and made sure they pronounced them properly the restaurant was excellent food service value for money  surprisingly reasonable considering it is very highly rated  the spa is a little small for the size of the hotel as it was very cold during our stay we couldn t enjoy all the outdoor areas if it had been warmer we would have probably spent longer there the indoor relaxation areas are very small and only two showers which seems a little odd only quibble with the room poor lighting in the bathroom makes it hard for us middleaged women to put on makeup ,positive,0,5,5,5

not all it is cracked up to be my husband and i just stayed at the royal palms hotel to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary although the grounds are very beautiful the rooms are romantic and t cook s restaurant and lounge and the service by the pool are all extraordinary the business end of the hotel leaves quite a bit to be desired when we arrived our room was not ready and the person at the checkin desk said he would call within the hour to let us know what the status of our check in would be when we had not received a phone call more than two hours later we stopped by the front desk the person did not seem to remember us but another person at the desk asked if our phone number was on file and said that she would call the second royal palms representative did call and we ended up checking in about 330 pm  which is a 1 2 hour before the scheduled checkin time even though i sent a request asking about an early checkin since i knew that we would be arriving around 10 am  although we understand that our room was not ready early i would have appreciated the call that the first representative said that he was going to make so that we could have made a better use of our afternoon i was surprised that the room did not have a fireplace i had called the property to inquire about fireplaces in the deluxe casitas  where we were booked  and was told that those rooms did have fireplaces yet we were placed in a room without one the room was cozy but i was looking forward to this particular amenity on the second night of our stay we had to call housekeeping to receive turn down service and request to have our towels changed my biggest problem with the royal palms was the checkout billing procedure first my minor issue i had asked for our boarding passes to be printed  since that is a service that the royal palms offers  but the person at the front desk did not remember to give them to me until i asked ok a little oversight but coupled with what followed it just made the little oversight magnified my major issue has to do with billing first we were given the wrong bill  with someone who was charged about half what we paid per night for lodging  then we were given our bill with three nights charges for rose petal turndown service when we only had that service the first night the royal palms checkout representative then deducted the subsequent two nights and informed us that we would receive an updated email version of our bill before we were charged i did not receive the email version of the bill but my credit card was charged for the total of the invoice i received upon departure and an additional amount after calling the resort several times to speak with someone in accounting i left a message asking someone to send me an updated  and corrected invoice with an explanation of any additional charges  when i received the email with an updated copy of my bill there was another fraudulent charge i spoke with someone after receiving that invoice and she seemed a bit annoyed with my inquiries and requests to have the charges explained and removed finally there were so many events being hosted at the royal palms  at least one every day of our visit  that the staff often seemed pulled away from their lodging guests it seemed that during our stay there was not sufficient staff to address the needs of all guests those lodging at the property and those hosting special events for a property of this size requesting what the royal palms requests per night for lodging service should be seamless and all guests should feel like they are very special we are not picky guests if it were not for the abovementioned snafus we would have never interacted with the royal palms staff since i had arranged all of our activities and dining options prior to arrival in the event that the service is not seamless and the guests are not made to feel extra special the property management should followup with guests to the best of their ability to explain the situation and offer some sort of compensation i have traveled extensively for business and pleasure and have stayed in large and small hotels where the management generally seemed to be concerned with the wellbeing of the guests i did not feel that this was the approach at the royal palms hotel ,negative,4,5,1,1
shy of perfection i had always heard good things about the royal palms  and obviously judging from the comments here it has many loyal followers  so i was looking forward to a weekend stay with my wife  at a nice offseason rate as many satisfied guests have noted the property is initimate wellgroomed historic romantic  part of its schtick is to promote romance  and an utterly refreshing change from the mega resorts like the biltmore and phoenician which are nearby on camelback these are high points along with the good service and friendly staff however we thought it didn t quite live up to our expectations and frankly i m a bit surprised at the surfeit of 5s in the tripadvisor ratings the royal palms is good   but that good we had a designer casita room which we thought was a bit dark and maybe a bit too inyourface with a romantic furnishing  to be fair this is the theme of the place  the bathtub in our room was mundane just a tub but it had a huge walk in shower  with only one head  far better we thought if the tub were a twoperson jacuzzi tub and the shower more routine  to stick with the romance theme  the room had two patios but the back patio was small the walls were high there was no planting or other vegetation it was quite claustophobic and the larger front patio  where we did sit and eat breakfast one morning  was not especially private people could walk right by within feet of our table  there were curtains we could pull across   but that just made it less scenic  our room also was noisy the ac was noisy but most of all there was a constant running of water like a toilet or shower was running next door maybe it was unique to this room  room 105  because we were at the end of a row of casitas and near the kitchen  could it have been kitchen plumbing  overall the room seemed very nice and pretty but not luxurious by any means incidentally these designer casitas are on the west side of the property and a bit isolated from the other rooms and casitas you should ask to be on the east side  you ll be closer to the pool and spa too finally to our minds one drawback was the lack of public rooms yes i know this is a boutique kind of establishment and i guess the expectation is that guests will walk the grounds or hole up in their rooms but a couple of indoor public spaces would have been nice the lobby here is not big  just a checkin area and when it s 110 outside the outside sitting areas are not always comfortable call me a nitpicker but it wasn t a perfect 5 at least if judged against other properties that try to reach the same customer base and at the same price range but i have no problem recommending it as a sweet alternative to the big resorts  especially if you are looking for a special romantic kind of getaway ,positive,4,3,3,4
beautiful hotel i stayed room 147 for 3 nights last month the room was a little old but it was clean so i did not mind i really liked the warm spanish design of the room interior the big walking closet was convenient the bedding sheet was so smooth that i enjoyed my sleep the bed curtain was pretty the gardens were very nice i enjoyed them everytime i walked outside the bar and restaurant were great i especially enjoyed sunday branch buffet there were 2 buffet prices one for 19 99 and the other for 29 99 19 99 buffet was buffet only 29 99 includes the buffet and one order from the branch menu the menu for the buffet and branch was sort of difficult to understand this system it does not state clearly what these prices include the buffet was excellent i was already full with the meal so i didn t a room to taste all the deserts unfortunately there were several kind of deserts which looked refined i ate only one desert which was a rapsberry square cake it was a small one in a big plate it had a tangy strong rapsberry taste and i personally liked it much the buffet was so beautiful that i feel like going back to phoenix only for that the steam room and juccuzi bath were located in alvadora spa but they were free to use anytime from 8am  8pm they will give you a locker room key parking was all convenient vallet parking only downsizing was that i had several mosquito bites in the room and outside of the room overall it was a great hotel and and i enjoyed my 3 nights ,positive,5,5,4,5
unforgetable anniversary my wife and i spent our 14th anniversary at the royal palms to put it simple if you are coming to scottsdale stay at this resort it is so great my wife and i felt like royalty during our stay from the service at the spa to the grapes and ice cold towels at the pool t cook s restaurant is awesome as well it made this celebration the best so far here s to next time    cheers   ,positive,0,5,0,5
really nice but some confusing aspects    if you are looking for a small classy intimate beautiful resort this is it the grounds and public areas are stunning there are cool little nooks and crannys where you can relax in peace my favorite thing is to see all the hummingbirds buzzing around in the early evening i haven t seen a casita or a suitei ve only stayed in a regular room here i stayed in a room in the 200 s on this trip the room wasfine especially the bath which is opulent and wonderful the closetin the room is small and there s no real dresser drawers there s coffee in the roomfrench press style which is greatand a fridge that doesn t charge you if you accidently pick up an item the rooms are a little dark but you can fully open the blinds for more light the only thing that perplexed me on this stay was the refilling of the minifridge and the coffee they give you enough inroom coffee for one usebut i was there for almost 3 days i figured the maid service would replenish it but no so i called the front desk and someone brings me a bunch of loose coffee in a drinking glass with plastic over it also i drank all the bottled water in the minifridge the first day but it was never replenished again i called to request it be replenished and they brought me some huge glass bottles of evian from the restaurant also my room did have a small ant problem over by the chairs i got bit on the toe by one and now the itching is driving me crazy but when you are in phoenix these things happen overall i would stay here again most definitely it s great to be in a place that is essentially free of screaming children for that reason alone i d go back i d probably choose to stay in a casita ,positive,5,0,4,1

a oasis in the desert i can t say enough good things about the royal palms this is a true 5 star resort even though it s located on the busy camelback road it s an oasis of calm with beautiful gardens tons of places to relax outdoors and comfortable casita style accomodations the restaurant is phenomenal the waiters and all of the staff were very knowledgable and affable i don t know why people are complaining about the resort fee when we tried to tip the valets and bellboys they did not want to take the money since gratuity is included and seemed really appreciative when we insisted i think it s worth the 20 bucks for smiling faces    i will definitely go back and hopefully stay for longer next time ,positive,4,5,5,5

windows wouldn t open view of hall and air conditioning machines this is the prettiest horrible hotel i have ever been to possibly the casitas in the old section are what gives it its rating we did not see one our corner plaze suite was big and an extremely long walk through two courtyards  my heart began sinking when i saw the first courtyard i had an idea what we were in for as i saw open windows and the people in the rooms and closed windows along the dark halls i was walking in  the door to our room opened to a large lovely living room with loud admittedly pretty stereo music greeting us all blinds were closed here and in the bedroom which adjoined when i opened them i realized why  the bedroom looked out on the air conditioning system  six huge compressors i tried to open the window  not a chance the living room looked out on a dark hall and blank wall with a table against it to stop the eye those windows didn t open either we were in sunny arizona with no way of breathing the air unless we propped our door open and craned our necks to see some sun and sky when we turned the stereo down we could hear the roar even when we left it on as we did all night there was still a strange highpitched noise we could not obliterate i walked the 10 minute walk back to the front desk with a wonderfully patient bellman working his second job while trying to get a real estate license to ask for a different choice my husband who had just broken his elbow horseback riding waited i was told i had booked the new plaza area i had never been told the difference the only other available room i was told was a deluxe room  no living room which might have been ok with me in exchange for air so we went to look that had a balcony and an opening door overlooking   the parking lot i didn t bother trying other choices actually supposedly there were none there were rooms that looked across a courtyard at other rooms not much of a choice if your room faced the road and the hall the other option your windows did nt open because it would be too noisy we actually could still hear the cars through the fan vent in the bathroom ceiling as mentioned in other letters the pool is too crowded the restaurant was fully booked for dinner when we got there but no one had suggested when i reserved a room that i also reserve for dinner in a way we turned out to be lucky as it was mostly closed in like the rooms i could go on as our daughter and her husband and two sons for whom i had also booked a room had sililarly difficult experiences what did i learn always ask if the windows open just because american express says it s a fine hotel don t believe it don t believe the pictures saving grace our room faced east and a lovely sunrise wakened us ,negative,0,0,2,3
a wonderful place my husband and i recently stayed at the royal palms for 5 nights in one of the plaza suites we received great service from everyone at the resort and also had a great dinner at the resort s restaurant t cooks we loved the smaller feel of this resort compared to other populart scottsdale resorts we visited like the phoenician  for drinks and the biltmore  for brunch  the grounds are absolutely beautiful and perfect for a romantic getaway i didn t see too many kids families there by the pool mostly couples or groups of adults relaxing we also each had a treatment at the spa and enjoyed them both we re not spaaddicts so we can t compare it to many other places but everthing was very professional and relaxing we would love to return  but have to save up again first   ,positive,0,5,0,5
royal palms not our old standby anymore well all good things must come to an end so be our eight year run at the royal palms resort in phoenix we thought about changing our annual hotel destination this year 2006 but decided why change something that has usually been good well we found out why the front desk staff needs some training and they need to learn how to treat a guest who has been a faithful to their hotel for this many return visits first our room choice had been requested for a month prior to our trip   then on the day of arrival a very specific room was asked for and was available only to be given away 5 minutes before we were given our room after we waited all day for the room to be cleaned etc then we were told no roll aways anymore   all of our previous visits we have had one so this was an issue this year   new rule that was a problem since the hotel was sold out for the night we were unable to have beds for all guests in our room then the staff was not accomodating in finding an alternative they offered the ritz which is not a resort spa we had to find our own alternative accomodations at 10 p m friday night and it basically ruined our evening and the next day as we had to check out and move the next day although moving to the phoenician was a pleasant one we have always had problems with the bills being incorrect at royal palms  we did for our one night too  and the pool service they had one nice guy at the rp taking care of the entire pool when they knew they were entirely booked at their hotel he was overworked and a little cranky but we understood his plight we just dont spend that kind of money to relax for a weekend away to be treated so poorly and with such disrespect for our vacation time we will definitely be writing to the royal palms to let them know their returning guests will be no longer   not that they care we will be happy to go to the phoenician where our rooms were large and spacious with superb expediant service in every arena of the hotel they may be a little larger but wow the service there is impeccable p s no maid service was knocking on doors at 830 on a weekend morning at the phoenician like at the royal palms   they need a few lessons on luxury accomodations  as we were checking out of the rp we noticed a lovely older couple who were wondering why they did not have the casita they had reserved 6 months in advance   they were very upset as well   they were heading to the four seasons we will definitely not go back too many other mishaps to list just lots of disappointments ,negative,0,0,0,1

paradise in the desert words can t even begin to describe this lovely bestkeptsecret tucked in the dusty foothills of camelback mountain the royal palms is an oasis of historic palm trees lush gardens vibrant lawns mosaic fountains and reflecting pools the entire experience appeals to all senses   the mourning doves cooing the gentle breeze carrying orange blossom perfume the cool mist from the poolside cabana the decadent food from the exquisitely appointed restaurant and lounge mom and i went for a girls weekend and indulged in alvadora spa treaments  orange blossom body buff and aromatherapy massage  the spa is handsdown  or handson the most decadent soulrefreshing spiritrejuvinating space in which i have ever had the pleasure of lounging it s a study in catering to one s every whim i could go on endlessly about the peppermint towels the plunge pool the private outdoor showers but suffice it to say that we nearly melted in the joy of simply being there the royal palms staff were infinitely helpful and friendly and the turndown service with chocolates was just one of the many nice touches of this special inn we will return again and again and again please don t ever change ,positive,0,0,5,5
a beautiful resort my boyfriend and i stayed at the royal palms june 23  26 i had a business meeting on the 23rd so we decided to use the opportunity to extend our stay i travel a lot for business and have stayed in some of the best resorts in the us the royal palms ranks in my top 3 my laptop crashed before my meeting and concierge offered their it services as well as finding me a data drs nearby even though it is a resort that most people go to to get away they are well equipped for business travelers kris at the front desk recommended daniel s  a small italian restaurant just down camelback it was wonderful i highly recommend it definitely book your spa appointment before you go  they book up very early  especially on friday and saturday it is understandable why this is one of the top ranked spas in the us the staff is very accomodating the grounds are beautiful the mediterranean decor is exquisite and the beds are soooo comfortable one of the best nights sleep i ve had on the road we loved it and would definitely go back if you are looking for a romantic getaway royal palms is it ,positive,0,5,5,5

like coming home only better   we just returned from spending the past week at the royal palms and there simply aren t enough good things to be said about our visit from the moment we arrived we were greeted by an amazingly friendly warm and caring staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome our first contact was with tony one of the valet attendants who opened our doors introduced himself and thereafter always knew us by name  this was a trait of everyone we met on the property   it was as if we were staying with friends who always greeted us this way  he took care of our luggage while we checked in and then gave us a tour of the property and then showed us to our room we splurged on a deluxe casita and it was well worth it the room was beautiful but then again what isn t beautiful at the royal palms the only other place we have seen that was so completely visually appealing was a resort we stayed at in tahiti obviously very different environments but beauty is beauty no matter where it s found the entire property makes you feel like you are living in a lovely watercolor painting the colors of the buildings and flowers and artwork all make for a serene and soothing atmosphere which you find yourself melting into very quickly the casita was beautifully decorated and very roomy we had a private patio in the back with a view of camelback mountain we had our own patio in the front as well  there are curtains you can let down to increase the feeling of privacy where we sat and enjoyed the lovely evenings the bathroom is a slice of heaven the huge walkin shower with builtin tiled seating is a spa treatment in itself and the selection of soaps and lotions that are provided are wonderfully luxurious we can t offer enough praise to everyone and we mean literally everyone who works there everyone is so happy and i don t mean in a freakish disney stepford way it s as if everyone there is absolutely thrilled to be doing their jobs and in finding ways to make you feel content and welcome we never heard a raised voice saw a scowling face or felt as if we weren t the most important guests there the food in the restaurants is wonderful if just a little pricey but then again you re paying for unsurpassed quality and service t cook s serves marvelous meals and the cabana grill has wonderfully casual lunches  and breakfast brunch on sundays and poolside drinks the poolside service is unsurpassed and again rick and jose  i can t say enough good things about the two of you either    make you feel as if you re visiting their home and by the joy they demonstrate when doing their jobs it s no wonder you feel that way we didn t use the spa but we visited the boutique area and it was beautiful as well and also well stocked with a wide assortment of spa products on our last night there we had the privilege of attending the general manager s reception in the presidential villa  where president bush had stayed just 2 weeks prior   regardless of your politics it s pretty cool to know you re standing in the bedroom where a world leader has recently slept   our wonderful friend jose was there and we also had the joy of meeting greg miller the gm rick behr delores  i hope i spelled your name correctly  the director of experiences and gregory casale the head chef they were all entertaining and charming and we had lovely drinks and hors d oeuvres which made for a great sendoff on our last night we were truly sad to leave them in fact when we left to go back to our casita jose made a point of stopping us and letting us know what a pleasure it had been to have us stay with them it felt so much like saying goodbye to a friend that we hugged him before we left my husband had seen the resort on great hotels on the travel channel but could not remember the exact name of the resort since we had never been to phoenix before that meant we had to search through every other highend resort property before he recognized the royal palms from its pictures even after having looked at all those other properties we just had a feeling about the royal palms and we couldn t have been happier to have made the choice we did there will be no other place for us to stay on any future visits to phoenix why would we coming back to the royal palms would be like coming home and as a testament to the commitment to service and care the royal palms offers look at the negative reviews of any of the other comparable resorts do you see any responses from those properties management no and in the scant negative comments i ve seen about the royal palms  both of which seemed to come from completely unreasonable people in my opinion  they took the time to respond and see if they could make things right that says it all to me this is the finest property in phoenix hands down i don t need to stay anywhere else to know that thank you to everyone at the royal palms who made our stay with you an absolute joy we will be back  ,positive,5,5,5,5

below the lowest standards hi folks i was so stupid to not do some research before i booked this travelodge mistake major mistake   let s start at the checkin well i couldn t even park my car in that area because too many parked cars where directly standing in the driveway so i got on the parking lot next to the travelodge when i saw trash like ripped out carpet in the parking lot i thought okay not the best neighborhood seems to be the place where some weirdos drop their trash then i walked over the grass wondering about beer bottles and stuff i didn t even want to see laying around on the grass in front of the travelodge i went up to the check in expecting a huge crowd because of the many parked cars but nobody was in the lobby with the exception of the checkin person who was doing the job of checking me in well that was pretty unenventful and i asked where the parking lot for the travelodge might be turned out i already parked my car on the trashed motel parking lot i got to my room 105 the jacuzzi suite if you are looking for a very scary place to spend halloween that 105 is your room nonsmoking room smelling like an ashtray wall paper missing on the wall electrical wires just laying around cut off i have not figured where they belonged to a bathtub i wouldn t even give my dog a bath in and she is really not picky a ironing board without the iron i guess that makes it a surf board for the poor electrical wires got fixed with some tape instead of getting really fixed if i would have had my kids with me i would have left right away no remote control for tv  well i grew up when the first generation of remote controls were invented maybe that news of the invention didn t get through to the travelodge minor inconvenience no internet access  one reason why i picked that place major problem for me since i run an internet business while looking for a phone to check with front desk what might be the problem i discovered they don t even put a phone in the room so i grabbed the motel information in hope i find some magic information for the internet connection big mistake with the exception of strip joint information most of the pages got ripped out in part next morning i wanted to take a shower being a bit on the taller side i figured out that most motel showers got designed for short people but when i got into the shower  good thing i wear glasses but not under the shower otherwise i would have need a couple of beers to get in there  and turned on the water i was waiting for a splashing noise instead i hear a stronger dripping noise yes the shower was turned on all the way but there was no pressure a light rain in phoenix has more power than that shower finally i only wanted to check out once i got to the front desk the guy working there was busy doing something  let s say freecell or solitaire on the computer he only looked at me with the expression of what do you want  i nicely told him that i would like to check out put down the keys and asked for the name of the manager what do you wantcan you please write me down the full name of the managerchad can you please write the full name downchad the manager his name is chad the manager very unusual name what is his real full namechad hill can you please write it down for metotally annoyed by getting asked to write down the name of the manager he grabbed a piece of paper and wrote down the name i thanked him and left knowing i will never ever stay there i travelled the globe never wrote a complaint before because usually you can arrange somehow but this time it was too much of reason to stay calm to make a long story short avoid this place ,negative,1,0,1,1
below your lowest standards stayed 3nights in this place when attending a conference in downtown phx absolutely dreadful do not stay here unless you have no other options poor room conditions and bathroom was not passable in any respect the hotel must have been an older 1960 s apartment building or something 2stories walkup outside entry neighborhood was very sketchy the unit i had turned out to be a 2 room with a small kitchen furniture looked like it came from the salvation army because it was not up to their standards at over 90 per night this was a very bad experience and i do not advise you to stay here under any circumstances ,negative,0,0,1,0
don t ever ever stay at this property  3101 n 32nd street upon entering the first room i was assigned i first noticed the safety lock was torn off the door frame followed by a grapefruit sized hole in one window the bed sitting on the floor the smoke detector hanging off the wall and the phone in pieces i then was given a deluxe room better than the first in that it didn t have broken windows etc when i went to sleep that night there was no blanket on the bed and when i called the desk i was told we don t put blankets on every bed i was also given only one towel  no wash cloths hand towels etc  and was told we are full and don t give everyone towels the bed also kept falling out of the frame several staff members and the repair guy were in and out of my room the next day i called travelodge customer service and filed a complaint i was told they would fax the property and attempt a resolution that night at about 300 am while sleeping in the bedroom area i was awoken by the sound of the front door closing i ran out and saw my laptop computer and some cash were missing  i had set the deadbolt and put the chain on  the chain was torn away from the frame i called the front desk and was told i was the only one with the key and what did i want them to do about it i said to call the police the officer determined that there was no forcible entry and that someone with a key card had entered the room the police were not able to get in contact with the manager i checked out in the morning the person at the front desk was able to get in touch with the manager he didn t want to speak with me and when i insisted he told me it was impossible etc and more or less accused me of lying he told me he would speak with his staff and would get back to me in a few days i have left numerous messages and sent a fax and have yet to hear from the him after 3 weeks worse yet i received a letter from travelodge corporate that basically says these are independent owners and all that corporate does is license the name there are no operating standards and the property is solely responsible i phoned the president s office and was told that by their franchise agreements they do not get involved ,negative,1,0,0,1

forget what i said in an earlier review i wrote a favorable review earlier about this hotel i returned in march of 2006  i was too busy to even think about writing another review so excuse the tardiness  earlier i described the hotel as a  hidden gem that s why i returned  i come to the phx area every march for spring training baseball now it is a rat hole other reviews have described the awful conditions i endured allnight parties with an overnight hotel agent who was either too sleepy or indifferent to my noise complaints  i checked out the following morning all of the descriptions you can read in other reviews are absolutely true  i was shocked at the condition of the hotel upon my return i can only assume not one dime has been invested in the property for maintence and upkeep i also was sickened by the hotel jacuzzi i developed a skin rash 2 days later i lodged a complaint with the az dept of health services  unfortunately as i checked out i told the clerk that the jacuzzi wasn t hot enough  that probably reminded management that they hadn t cleand the tub in weeks of course by the time the azdh inspected they were given a clean bill of health if you want to search you can probably find the complaint on file if you do not want to take me at face value when i praised that hotel earlier i meant what i said at that time the property was a great value for the price i now completely have an opposite view i did contact travelodge and they never returned emails it s obvious why this chain is slowly vanishing as i note their hotel guide gets smaller every years customer service sorry not with travelodge i would only hope this lodge is deleted from the travelodge chain also this hotel is a sister to another travelodge in mesa on the east side of town i did stay there once but that was over 8 years ago i remember the a c broke there the night i stayed and temps that march were soaring to 90 degrees avoid both of these facilities at least the property in east mesa doesn t have prostitutes soliciting you by the way i would not at all describe the neighborhood as a  crime zone  i believe the only such zone in the neighborhood is the hotel itself but yes the area seems to be zoned for  barnyard animals as pets and yes there are more than a few roosters that can be heard that s more comical than  crimeridden  but a night at this hotel is not funny at all shame on travelodge for having their logo on this disgrace ,negative,1,0,1,1

enjoyed our stay we just stayed at the legacy golf resort for a week from october 3rd to october 10th it was our first time to arizona and really enjoyed it our room was immaculate and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed we ate breakfast in the condo every morning and had lunch at the resort twice the food was excellent in the restaurant we drove to the grand canyon and sedona for a couple of days amazing scenery  we did lots of shopping and really enjoyed shopping at the anthem mills outlet about a 30 minute drive north of the legacy we did the walk at 900 a m two of the mornings we were there with jeannie it was a little over an hr and we were able to chat and get some exercise in while seeing more of the area we used the pool area they provided lots of towels and lounges and umbrellas for shade they don t allow you to bring food into the pool area and we felt sorry for the families with young children because they were told they couldn t give their children their snacks they could only eat the food sold in the pool area there are lots of good restaurants within driving distance from the legacy and also scottsdale was fun to visit and not a far drive also i just want to add the staff were all very friendly and service was very good ,positive,0,5,4,4

new rulesno bar service for the pool after 6 pm four of us decided to enjoy sunset by the pool with a few margaritas we went to dinner at a local restaurant and arrived at the pool near 6 pm the guys in the group went to get drinks and were directed by the bartender to go to the clubhouse as the pool bar was closing the clubhouse told them that their liquor license did not allow them to serve us drinks to take to the pool i questioned the bartender who was very rude and asked for a manager the manager ryan confirmed that the concession to the restaurant and the pool bar had been sold to different parties effective jan 2006 as a result liquor laws did not allow them to serve liquor in the other location we actually observed the pool staff confiscate someone else s drink later we left the pool and went to the clubhouse for drinks and appetizers karen an excellent waitress indicated that while they could give us drinks in plastic cups to take to our room we shouldn t take them to the pool because they would be taken from us i can t imagine that a resort would expected vacationers not to enjoy a drink by the pool at sunset it is an essential part of the vacation experience for me ,negative,0,0,0,3
consistently poor service stayed here for a wedding in midapril 2007 the property is great looking the golf course is amazing the pool is very nice we will not be back why customer service they have 18 year olds running the place there was one person at checkin no rooms were ready before 400pm a lot of guests were waiting to checkin around the pool all day we all talked and we all had early checkin requests the concierge was a 20 year old girl that spent her days emailing and text messaging on her cell phone we would ask her a question and she would not even look up away from her phone mind you we paid 109 a night because we were part of the wedding group but i would have gladly paid more and stayed at the nearby marriott resort seriously do not stay here ,negative,4,0,3,1
great trip great hotel experience we travel a lot and this year we landed in phoenix in anticipation of staying at the legacy golf resort we ve heard a lot about the resort from my husband s golf buddies overall the trip was great the hotel was very clean the staff went over and above for us the rooms were spacious and nicely decorated overall we were very happy and highly recommend it ,positive,0,0,0,5
legacy customer service is substandard we recently booked a suite at the legacy golf resort in phoenix and had one of the worst customer service experiences that we have ever experienced during our travels upon checkin the staff appeared to have little time to check in the guests that had arrived after waiting in line for approximately half an hour we were told that our room was not ready and there was no clear indication given when it would be ready upon further inquiry including a request to speak to the management we were finally given a room number and told that we could check in when housekeeping was finished cleaning the room the reason given for the delay was that the previous guests had checked out late and the resort had no control over this however as we approached our suite we noticed that several of the other suites were still in the process of being cleaned leading us to believe that the resort was understaffed one of the points made by management while we were booking the suite was the fact that we would love the room and it was worth the wait because we would have a wonderful view of the mountains  golf course from our upper balcony when we were finally able to occupy the room we stepped onto the balcony and had a wonderful view    of two large eucalyptus trees   which totally blocked any other view we have booked suites at this resort several times in the past and are very reluctant to do so in the future because of the poor customer service ,negative,0,0,0,1
longest week of our life we traded a week of timeshare to stay here and what a mistake the customer service was consistently bad however the food was worse the restaurant bar was supposed to close at 10pm but on 2 different nights it closed early our sheets were too short and when we called about housekeeping they offered to deliver sheets but it stopped there we had housekeeping once for the entire week the shower head was like standing under a high pressure washer without any actual hower we were given bad information during checkin about the internet and then when questioned to resolve the issue was told sorry we can t do anything about it overall it was a disappointing resort and i would never recommend it ,negative,0,1,0,1
i m just glad it was free my husband and i stayed here for one night as an incentive for sitting through some boring sales pitch for 2 hours about time sharing however i m just glad it was free the refridgerator ran all night long it was so annoying i turned it off at one point it was so bad the hotel s restaurant was soso we ordered hamburgers and fries that tasted like something you could cook at home our waiter was pompous and lazy when i told him i wanted to order a hamburger he looked at me like i had three heads i guess he s never heard of a hamburger before and we had to ask the bar wench to refill our waters since he was too busy lollygagging in the kitchen with the other employees overall i m just glad it didn t cost me a cent i certainly would have been mad if i actually had to pay for this crap ,negative,0,3,0,1
great resort if you re white   we recently stayed at the legacy golf resort for a week it was going well until we started using their fitness facility i was basicallly booted out of the fitness center because i was not white i felt like a black man in a kkk meeting i thought racism has died down since the 70 s apparently i am dead wrong racism and prejudice is still very much alive in this country and in particular arizona i would nt recommend staying at this resort unless you are white ,negative,0,0,0,1
great resort has everything you need just got back from four nights at the legacy golf resort i chose the resort based on positive reviews on this website and was not disappointed this is not a particularly fancy resort but it has everything you need for a very comfortable stay especially for families because of the apartmentlike facilities in the unit on the other hand i was there by myself and did not feel besieged by kids running around because the resort is spread out enough the resort is part of the shell timeshare system but there is no pressure to join the resort consists of about a dozen clusters of twostory townhouses each unit has a balcony or patio you can sit on i asked for a unit with a view and got one on the second floor facing the 18th fairway which was nice i had a studio which was spacious with a king size bed sitting area with sofa and two armchairs and a full kitchen  sink half size fridge coffee maker toaster stove with two burners washing machine dishes glasses pots and pans utensils don t remember if there s a microwave  the unit also has a stacked washer dryer which was very handy they provide soap for the dishwasher and also to handwash dishes but for some reason no soap for the washer dryer but no biggie the room was clean and seemed relatively new no dirt peeling wallpaper or other visible signs of wear there is housekeeping service every day as in a regular hotel parking is outside each unit the grounds are very well kept checkin was smooth the staff at the registration desk is young and somewhat less polished than the five star resorts but they were friendly and efficient i had a problem with the high speed internet connection in my room  9 95 for 24 hours and they moved me to another room right away at my request instead of sending someone to fiddle with the wires the main building also houses the golf pro shop restaurant and spa gym i tried each of these the pro shop is well stocked and well run the golf course was in good shape and well maintained it scores 4 5 stars in golf digest which is as high as any golf course in the phoenix area it s not a fancy course but i enjoyed my round especially at the twilight rate of 25  for guests and 29 for nonguests which starts at noon yes it s hot but you have to expect that if you go to phoenix in june i had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant it s good basic food like you would expect in a clubhouse a little pricey for what you get but not outrageous and the service was very good no complaints there i didn t use the spa services but did use the gym which was reasonably well equipped with two treadmills bicycles weights and so on the swimming pool is next to the main building and is popular with families though i did not use it the resort is about ten minutes south of the airport as others have noted you pass through a couple of spotty neighborhoods on the way there and you may want to think twice about stopping at the nearby gas stations late at night because of the people who hang out there but the resort itself is fine and there are security guards driving around the parking lots all the time i felt very safe there are a couple of shopping malls only five minutes away by car  in another direction and the resort is centrally located for access to other golf courses restaurants and so on i think the positives of the resort s location outweighs the negatives allinall the legacy is a great place to stay without the expensive frills the summer rates are amazing and you can book directly through their website i highly recommend this place ,positive,2,4,4,4
great vacation very clean and spacious just returned from one week at the legacy golf resort i highly recommend this resort  my husband and i are frequent time share travellers and legacy was one of the places we were able to use as reciprocity for our membership all of the staff were very courteous and went out of their way to be helpful also since we are frequent time share travellers we are often hit with the sales pitch of buying into the time share we are staying at this did not happen at the legacy there were no whining hounding sales calls  which was very welcome my husband is an avid golfer and highly enjoyed the course at the legacy he played four different times the grounds were immaculate the pool area very clean and the linens always fresh we did not experience the restaurant or bar so i cannot comment highly recommend this place   ,positive,0,0,4,5
wonderful unit close proximity to airport my husband and i stayed at the legacy for two nights in a onebedroom upstairs corner unit which overlooked the golf course after reading the reviews i requested an upstairs unit quiet location nice view i was very pleased and surprised when my requests were met the furnishings are very nice the unit was spotlessly clean and the view from our balcony was lovely the people at the front desk were pleasant and efficient i particularly liked the gym which afforded a pleasant view of the golf course we got takeout food from the restaurant there which was reasonably priced and tasty enough the swimming pool looked to be nice too but we re not swimmers so we never ventured into it now that first night we hardly slept we kept hearing what sounded like the front door opening and footsteps coming down the hall i was a bit scared and even got up to investigate more than once big brave me if i had been staying on my own i d have called the front desk to enquire what was going on by the way we heard the same noises during the day in addition to other odd noises we never did figure out what the noises were and in the end surmised that perhaps the place is haunted or it could be the building settling however all in all we d stay at the legacy again its close proximity to the airport is an added attraction ,positive,5,5,5,5
absolutely fantastic resort  my husband and i stayed at the legacy resort for 7 days beginning october 15th this was a beautiful resort with great landscaping fantastic views and incredibly good food in their restaurant we stayed at a time when they were reseeding the golf course so it was a pleasure not to be crowded with golfers the view of south mountain in the evening was beautiful and romantic we had a 2 bedroom condo combination and it was larger than my home with beautiful red marble bathrooms and topnotch furniture and kitchen appliances we ve stayed in a number of gold crown timeshares and this place was the absolute best i can t say enough good things about this place and would not hesitate to go again ,positive,5,5,0,0
had a great time with legacy we loved the legacy we stayed there for four nights in early october we had a studio suite room with a golf course view we were on the second floor first of all our room had tons of amenities we had a kitchenette with a microwave two burner stove minifridge toaster coffee maker even a washer and dryer as an earlier reviewer noted the beds are a little on the firm side but i did not find that it inhibited my sleep additionally a young family did check into the adjoining suite during our stay and i did notice noise as a result however i do not think it was enough of a problem to keep me from staying at the legacy again the views of the golf course from our balcony were great and the pool was large and uncrowded with a fun little pool bar the resort practically abuts south mountain park in phoenix and the resort activities staff offered lots of free activities for guests  watercolor painting hiking in the park etc  they also have a fitness room that is complimentary for guests we ate in the resort restaurant and the food was wonderful  i had a creamy rich steak diane  as well we thought our rooms were extremely wellpriced  we booked them through an online booking service and got a great deal  all in all we really enjoyed our stay at the legacy if i were visiting phoenix again i d definitely consider staying there ,positive,5,5,5,5
simply the best stayed for 11 nights and didn t want to return home the site was kept spotlessly clean and was immaculately manicured i cannot speak highly enough of the staff all were extremely friendly and helpful particularly those in the restaurant and in the golf shop played the course twice it s excellent but the bunkers are punishing the cost to use the range 15 was unbelievable what value free to use chipping and putting  fantastic if i had to mention a negative the choice from the restaurant menu is slightly limited although the food and service is excellent however part of a good holiday is exploring places to eat and there is plenty of choice just a short drive away in conclusion this was absolutely the best place i have ever stayed i would wholeheartedly recommend it and cannot wait to return  again and again  ,positive,0,4,0,5
warning   legacy doesn t honor reservations   on january 20 i booked and paid for my april 22 23 reservation at the legacy i had a paid confirmation for a one bedroom suite upon arriving at the legacy we were informed that we were moved to another hotel in the area they had given away our room and there were no rooms left we were told that people stayed longer than expected so our room was not available the hotel they sent us to was a business type hotel and we did not get a suite and the room overlooked the parking lot not even close to the accommodations that we had booked at the legacy the manager at the legacy did not care he only kept repeating that he understood but could do nothing about it he also told me that they had move 25 reservations that same day   also the map they gave us to find the new hotel was printed on march 2004  so they must have a stack of these handy because they do it so often so a word of warning i would not suggest ever booking here because you can not trust that reservations will be honored we had paid for our room on january 20 for an april 22nd stay also we book through expedia who could do nothing about it either ,negative,0,0,0,1
think twice after having twice been to the legacy we would not go again the first time several things went wrong but we thought perhaps next time things would go more smoothly wrong the first time we were there we discovered that the food in the grill was awful tasteless hamburgers and bland salads further the restaurant allowed people to stand their children on the tables  as an example  there was no hostess and so one could be left waiting for a table for a long time the pool was o k but music blared with grating songs the second time we went the following items went wrong in our room the tub wouldn t drain  they had to come back twice to fix it  the icemaker didn t work  theyfixed it but it still didn t work  the ironing board wouldn t stand up the dryer was broken one wastebasket was broken the beds were made a 400 and the sheets were never tucked in so they came undone in the night we loved their golf course and practise facilities the staff is very friendly and the massage therapists are excellent   that s why we gave it a second chance but there really was too much to overlook to go again ,negative,0,1,0,5

most likely never again the hotel didn t impress me at all we arrived slightly early and they said they didn t have rooms available yet while lots of people were checking out and some where checking in   the location is not great but for business that didn t matter the room was what impressed me the least old small not usual marriott quality especially for the price i was paying ,negative,2,0,2,1
a bit expensive the hotel is pretty good the room was spacious and with high speed internet connection the breakfast was very good my only objection for this hotel concerns its pricing policy in the hotel s online description about the rooms it is nowhere stated that highspeed internet is on extra charge  about 25 aud per day i do not remember exactly  furthermore the breakfast was not included in price so this was an extra cost  although they gave me a lower price because i bought 5 breakfasts from the first day  finally allthoygh i had payed the room in advance for 5 days they reserved additional 50aud per day from my credit card just in case of extra expenses  this happened before my decision to buy breakfast and high speed internet access  so if i knew all these before making my reservation at this hotel perhaps i would choose another ,negative,5,0,2,3

loved it i booked this hotel on wotif for a long weekend away with my partner i wasn t expecting much from it but was overly impressed by the room it was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was spacious with an enormous bathtub not a spa but still relaxingthe only downfall was the size of the tv a big flat screen would have been better in the room we didn t have a park view room but our view was still excellent you could see the wharf at woolamooloo and the lights were amazing ,positive,0,0,4,0
don t bother with the executive lounge i booked this hotel through wotif com au for my husbands birthday we chose the executive room with access to the executive lounge the rooms are clean and beds comfortable great location don t bother to book the executive lounge rooms below are the problems  i booked the executive level room and we were placed in room 1706 not on the top 2 floors as stated in the booking when we checked in we were given no information about the executive lounge and had to look it up in the hotel directory we then had to wait 30 minutes for our luggage to be delivered to our room i had to ring to find out where our luggage was we also received no evening turndown on either night nor were there any bathrobes in the room these are all listed items on the hotel website the wesite also states that there is a cooktop and pans in the executive room which was not there during our stay the top level was closed for renovations so no spa pool etc access this should be stated on the website the hotel also states that cocktails are available in the executive lounge this was not the case as there was only one staff member and nowhere set up to have a cocktail made there was also no cutlery set up for the evening canapes or breakfast when we arrived for breakfast at 9am there was a very limited selection left and we were told that was all that was available as breakfast was until 10am the plates should have been replenished with enough selection until 10am when breakfast finished this is an executive lounge in a 5 star hotel and the service was not good enough ,negative,5,2,3,1
adequate   this hotel is passable but not really value for money rooms are clean and adequately furnished but slightly on the small side the pool area is lovely and probably the highlight breakfast buffet was good but not exceptional  was very disappointed to find tepid scrambled eggs in a bain marie rather than being made fresh all in all sufficient for a sydney hotel but for the prices would like something a little special ,negative,0,2,2,0
marriott was great we turned up at the marriott on a friday night without a booking after discovering the hotel we booked had allocated us a room next to a noisy lift shaft the marriott staff found us a very comfortable room with views of hyde park at a reasonable rate they were extremely helpful courteous and helped with maps and transport plans for the following two days a paper was sent to our room each day the beds were the most comfortable i have slept in and the bathroom had a very large bath we found the service and friendliness of the staff a lovely welcome to sydney and i will definitely stay at one of their hotels again ,positive,5,0,5,5
hop round the corner the marriott hotel college street sydney was right up to expectations the staff are particularly customer aware and friendly the hotel is well situated to the central cdb and the stroll across hyde park each morning and evening was very pleasant  just a little gtrizzle the in room internet charge is too expensive aud29 00 per 24 7 don t connect hop round the corner to the vodafone internet cafe very clean and well set out 2 00 for 30mins all i needed for checking email etc some nice restuarants nearby oxford street has many but the street is dirty and though i did not feel unsafe it seems to be the gathering place for the gay and lesbian people and the homeless the museum station  underground rail is on opposite corner of hyde park and ideal for taking the airport train to sydney airport 14 00 one way would recommend marriott for visitors wanting centrally located accomodation and adjacent facilities ,positive,4,0,3,5
interesting experience my husband and i just returned from a five night stay at this hotel there are many positive things to say about this marriott                however                  first of all  we arrived early in the am after a long overseas flight from the us we were pleasantly greeted and were thrilled to get an early checkin to our room the room was very nicely appointed although as previous reviewers have mentioned the hotel is older and a little worn the couch in our room definitely had some threadbare areas however our kingsized bed was very comfy continuing on the positive note  we had a room overlooking hyde park the hotel is in a beautiful and convenient location although it is about a mile from the harbor we are used to walking and enjoyed the exercise this was wonderful for our needs  perhaps others might want to be located right on the waterfront public transportation is readily available nearby we had no problem getting to most of the sights once we became oriented to the area food in the hotel is pricey once we got our bearings we were able to find nice restaurants although it took a little bit of searching sydney is a very walkable city  once you figure it out it is fine just a tip  take the exployer bus on day one  you pay for it and pick it up at circular quay  it is a good value and will give you an excellent feel for the city on our last day in sydney we felt that there was quite a bit of activity and excitement in the hotel we quickly learned that we were there for the day of gay and lesbian mardi gras our hotel was located literally at ground zero of the mardi gras parade prior to this we could not figure out why we had to pay 310 for that night at the hotel  our previous nights at the hotel were considerably lower in price  i do wish that this had been explained to us when making the reservation anyway one could be  a comfortable in this situation or  b uncomfortable in this situation since we were there only as visitors from the us  and there by coincidence it was a very uneasy situation for us the hotel did its best to maintain security and limit excessive partying but a very lively atmosphere prevailed again  avoid this time in sydney if mardi gras is not in your plans i fault the marriott hotel for not explaining this in advance i would give this hotel a better review if they had explained this to us and if we did not feel gouged regarding our room rate for that night anyway  enjoy sydney it is a beautiful city to visit ,positive,5,0,4,4
fantastic experience loved the marriott what i liked1 very comfortable room spacious had a microwave and a sink 2 large bathroom   huge bathtub 3 location is good cbd is a 5 min walk hyde park is across the road oxford street round the corner has great food and drink options 4 service is great i thought my camera was stolen and i reported that to reception they went to great lengths to investigate it much appreciated i found the camera in my own bag later 5 complimentary chocolate left on my bed by the housekeeper 6 rooftop swimming pool is awesome with a great view what i disliked1 the room and fittings are a bit dated though not ugly what i m neutral about1 the gym looked alright though i didn t use it2 the bars  restaurants seemed fine too but i didn t use them ,positive,5,4,5,5
one of the best hotels i ve stayed in i could find anything wrong with this hotel except that i felt that the internet was expensive the hotel is nice and clean staff is friendly breakfast is good it would not hurt to upgrade the gym i look forward to stay there again location is great ,positive,5,4,4,4
good hotel with some flaws this hotel is located in central sydney on hyde park next to oxford street my room was large and with a nice panoramic view over east sydney the bad was comfortable broadband internet access in the room costs aud 29 per day  too much in my opinion the bathroom was ok it had a huge bathtub but the lightning was really bad and there was no heating which made the bathroom terribly cold if you didn t leave the door open during the day service was friendly but not perfect i found a piece of plastic in my musli at breakfast one day and on my complaint the headwaitress just took the plate away  no excuse or offer to bring me a new plate the breakfast restaurant is also too small for the size of the hotel people had to queue for 2030 minutes to get a table on sunday the hotel has a small gym with two treadmills one stepper one stationary bike and a multipurpose weight station the good thing is that it is open 24 hours but it could be a bit bigger for my taste ,negative,5,3,3,2
too expensive no service and poor breakfast we stayed at this marriott from dec 30 to january 2007 location is great but this hotel is max 3 stars even if we have paid for a 5 stars the staff told us always yes but they did not do anything  no restaurant bookings no information about fireworks tickets     room service did not make the room properly  3 of the 5 days see pictures breakfast is very small for 3 days there was no fried eggs or omelets option small cheese plate was always empty no fresh juices coffee and tea terrible and we had to wait every morning at least 20 minutes to get a table if you get a great price the location is very nice but do not pay too much and do not expect marriot standards ,negative,4,1,1,1
great experience at the sydney marriott during a holiday period i stayed at this marriott on dec 30 and 31 2006 amazingly with no hotel rooms available in the city on new year s eve i was able to get this 5star property on dec 31 for marriott rewards points  so if you re looking for a new year s eve hotel room next year and have marriott points to use      my 14th floor room had a nice city view over to the mountains and a huge triangular soaking tub  not whirlpool spa but it was the size of the typical spa tubs found in marriotts in the us  i found it to be a great retreat from the bustle of the downtown sydney cbd  central business district  hyde park is across the street the hotel has a rooftop pool which when i was there was generally not crowded it s near the museum cityrail underground train station and a 2030 minute walk from the restaurants and shops at darling harbor staff were very friendly as someone else mentioned the concierge service during my stay was top notch up there with the best i ve ever experienced in a hotel  the other great experiences were also in marriotts and this is largely why i prefer the brand  in particular mark was very helpful to me internet costs an amazing 24 95 day aud you re probably better off using one of the 5 halfhour public machines in the business center or getting out of the hotel to use an even less expensive internet cafe  they re plentiful in sydney unless you need the security of a personal connection on your personal notebook full breakfast  hot cold was 32 aud which isn t the greatest value in the world but seemed in line with most meal pricing in sydney since marriott breakfast buffets are good fuel for a busy day of touring or work even if it s a bit much i recommend it they were also nice enough to store most of my luggage for a few extra days between checkout and my departure from australia while i visited with a friend who lived on one of the northern beaches i ll definitely stay there again when visiting sydney and i recommend this property to others ,positive,5,3,4,5
great location helpful staff stayed at the in town marriott just as the weather turned warm for the summer the air conditioners worked well this is a great location to walk through town somewhat less touristy then the other marriott located at the harbour we stayed on a high floor the views were impressive could see all the way to the beaches room was average size with odd bathroom arrangement but very comfortable executive level amenities were less than average for a marriott the staff however made up for that everyone was very helpful and especially the door staff easy walk to shopping restaurants and night life ,positive,5,0,4,5
fabulous experience strange bathroom marriott has yet one more reason for an excellent reputation of service and quality this hotel is between a 4 5 star but without a doubt service is a 5 the employees at this hotel are fabulous and will do whatevers asked or not we were unfortunate enough to have a party member fall extremly ill and needed a thermometer immediatly and the concierge offered to run home and get theirs if they could not locate a pharmacy they also handled our kids mistakes and calls at all ours of the day with extreme grace and understanding the hotel was impecably clean and in a quiet location the way the bathroom is shaped is the strangest we have ever seen and not up to typical marriott standards but is encased in marble anyways regardless the shower is steaming hot and controllable nice place with great staff ,positive,5,0,4,5
beautiful location lovely clean room wonderful service after fleeing another very disappointing hotel we were so happy to be at the good ol reliable marriott this marriott had excellent attentive staff who were helpful with everything from luggage to dinner plans our room had huge windows looking over beautiful hyde park  definitely ask for a park view room  the bed pristine white and soooo comfy the bathroom was large and fabulous with a huge bathtub we were traveling with a 4 year old  so having a refridgerator microwave and toaster was really helpful we also appreciated the electric teapot and fixings for tea the location across from hyde park was wonderful providing lovely walks and easy access to lots of the sydney attractions the pool area is pretty although we would have been very happy if the pool were just a bit warmer the lobby is huge and provides several out of the way spaces to sit and talk you can have unlimited internet access in your room for a flat fee or use their set up off the lobby address 36 college street sydney nsw 2010 australia  ,positive,4,0,4,5
where s the message i flew a mate up from melbourne and left a message at the front desk of the marriott for him to meet us at the wooloomooloo hotel the front desk staff changed shifts lost our note and our friend languished in the lobby for about 3 hours he then went out to another pub we came back then we wanted to go out again and no sign of him so basically it was a total stuff up  the kind that shouldn t happen when you pay marriotts prices and 300 for your friend s air ticket i have vowed never to stay at a marriott ever again just on principle the rooms are as ordinary as their service ,negative,0,0,1,1
very dissapointed when i arrived i was greeted at my car door by the concierge who was very polite seeing as this was my first impression i thought that the hotel would be of high standards   boy was i wrong the hotel staff were polite and helpful the rooms were nice but the breakfast was disgusting i had ordered room service and expected my hot chocolate to be hot  it was luke warm and wasn t very chocolatey at all and the toast was cold and the bread seemed stale also in your rooms you are given a complementry robe mine was tatty and should have been thrown out inside the arm pit there were many holes i just felt that the standards weren t very high the hotel would have to change before i d stay there again ,negative,0,1,1,4

excellent location as most have said this location cannot be bettered right down the road there are water taxis ferries buses and the subway but since you are right near the quay you might not want to leave the hotel is a typical large high class impersonal hotel we had no particularly good view from our room great shower clattering toilet seat heavy quilt we ate a delicious steak dinner in the restaurant the first night but for breakfast went a block down the street to starbucks for a coffee and croissant i like the hyde park marriott better because it is easier to drive to they have a coin laundry and all around it is friendlier can t beat the location on the quay though ,positive,5,5,4,4

great hotel  cold food this is a great hotel with very clean and nicely appointed rooms with lovely views of the harbour staff were generally very friendly and we had no real problems except we felt the food was ordinary we ordered hot food from the bar menu after coming back after a show and not only was there a long wait it was basically cold when we got it cocktails were small and overpriced for what you got the food in the buffet breakfast was cold also i selected my food from the buffet and went straight back to my table and it was hardly warm and certainly cold by the time i was about half way through great location and place to stay but be careful of the food we didn t have an evening meal in the restaurant though so i can t comment on that they need to watch those food temperatures though or someone is going to end up with some serious food poisoning ,negative,0,1,3,4
fascinating experience hotel location  the ambience is completly out of the world starting from morning to the night every time you peep out of the window you get a completly different  fascinating view the hotel staff  the services provided are top notch but the options available at the restaurant can be better i would suggest that you take your rooms on the second floor from where the view of the opera house bridge  the sea is fabolous for indians the best option is to stray out  go to the road side cafe s ,positive,5,0,5,5

irritated by the bad service and duplicate charges yesterday was our wedding day it was a perfect day until we checked into the marriott on circular quay we live in sydney so we had booked into the marriott as a treat for our wedding night we had booked through another website so we had paid in advance when we were checking in we were in our wedding clothes so the receptionist was very nice to us and even said he would send up a complimentary bottle of wine to celebrate the wedding he also offered us a late check out of 1pm we headed up to our room which was pretty basic we called room service and asked for some bath robes so that when we returned from our wedding dinner we could change out of our formal clothes after about an hour we went to dinnerthe bath robes had still not arrived after we returned from dinner we checked for the bathrobes as i was dying to take off my corset and wedding dress no bathrobes so my  new  husband called down and asked for them again we were told they had already been delivered we checked the whole roomno sign of them to this the person on the phone sighed and responded that they had been delivered but he would send the guy up with two more and that it may take a while as the guy who delivers robes was busy eventually as we were about to fall asleep the robes were delivered the robe guy was pretty apologetic and said that he had delivered the robes to the room next door earlier by accident there were also a number of other problemsthe cold water was not running in the sink so the only choice for hand washing was hot water only which was uncomfortably hot of course we never received our complimentary bottle of wine and we just checked our bank account and they have charged us a second time for the hotel room i m not sure why they charged us again as when my husband checked out there was no outstanding charges on the bill i called to see what the charge was for and before i could even explain the situation a very rude lady told me i would have to contact accounts when they open at 9am tomorrow so yes i don t think i would recommend the marriott and we definitely will not be using this chain again we were expecting a great experience from a 5 star hotel we have had much better experiences in other hotels ,negative,4,1,1,1
valet parking warning do not leave your car in the hands of this hotel the valets damaged our vehicle while parking it when we handed over the keys to our car they did not warn us about the risk of leaving our car with them we have given the hotel a chance to respond but after months of phoning and emailing their employee derek malley and the general manager jennifer brown they refuse to accept responsibility if you are willing to take the risk and leave your car with this hotel be prepared to wait 15 minutes for them to retrieve the car also this hotel takes many coachloads of tourists the porters will just leave the luggage of 100 people across the inside entrance of the hotel so if you are travelling alone or as a couple be prepared to carry your own bags and to wade through miles of luggage to get out of the front entrance of the hotel ,negative,0,0,0,1
unfriendly front desk staff  what a disappointment the marriott sydney habour at circular quay was the rooms were wrong and not ready even though i had booked and paid at least 8 months in advance they booked the rooms in my soninlaw s name and wouldn t even put my name on my room even though i booked the rooms in my name and was expecting an important phone call what kind of rule is that the staff was rude snobbish and couldn t care less about our discomfort the rooms were no better the refridgerator was nt cold we had to buy ice and pay for the delivery the location was okay but certainly was nt worth price of the awful treatment of the clerks or the mediocre rooms emma  ,negative,3,0,1,1
fantastic location you can t beat the location you really are paying for that the indoor pool was cold to me    i don t know if it was really heated or not the bed was extraordinarily comfortable i sat on the windowsill and watched the sun rise over the opera house    that was great your view of the opera house is going to be of the back of it so keep that in mind ,positive,5,0,4,0
overpriced and not up to usual marriott we are frequent marriott users and were very disappointed the standard room was small and could have been any 4 star hotel the worst thing was the service though because we were sightseeing we got back late a few nights and ate in the bar the food took forever to come and was a very limited menu and not good nor hot when it came it was almost impossible to get a waiter to take our order for drinks and my husband ended up every night going to the bar and getting them himself cocktails are very overpriced small and not very good seafood buffet was good though location of hotel great though we highly reccommend a nearby chinese restaurant to eat  you turn out of the hotel to the right and go up an escalator in the next building along to the first floor it looks like you are going into an office block but it s there the food is wonderful as evidenced by the number of chinese eating there also if you go in the door before its a well hidden small shopping mall adn you can get away from the bustle of sydney in a courtyard and get a coffee sandwich pastry or go to the chemist or newsagent we are huge marriott fans but this hotel was a great dissappointment  ,negative,5,1,1,1
mixed feelings about hotel i stayed in the hotel on 21 june 2008 i was a bit disappointed because i originally booked  through the marriott website a nonsmoking king bed room we checked in very early on 21 june and our room was not ready so we came back late in the peace when we came back to the hotel we were given a double bed smoking room i was extremely disappointed with this as i specifically asked that my preference would be a nonsmoking room double bed but i got smoking i had previously stayed at the marriott in victoria canada in 2007 and was very impressed with the facilities and location unfortunately with these expectations in mind i was expecting that the sydney harbourside marriott would be the same  unfortunately it wasn t as good i do have to say that the marriott in victoria was recently renovated in the last year but the harbourside marriott has not been and i saw this in the room for those who were thinking of staying in a opera house room  i stayed in one of these rooms on the 19th floor  it is not quite what you think you can see the opera house but the view is seen through in between 2 buildings to the left and right of the window  you don t have a 180 degree view which looks directly onto the opera house  if that makes any sense  also your room faces east so when you go and open the blinds in the morning the sun comes directly into your room face and blinds you i do not recall seeing in the room a usb port  which i saw at the victoria marriott which would have been handy to charge an ipod  for example  the reason why i m posting this post is because of something that happened on the evening of 21 june which i was a bit concerned about i went down to the health club on saturday evening around 7pm firstly the spa was empty and did not have any water in it  was covered up  so if you have expectations of having a spa in the winter at this marriott forget it secondly for those who have children and were thinking about using the pool the pool does not have a shallow depth for you to stand on  i was planning to do some aqua exercises and couldn t because i m short and couldn t touch the bottom of the swimming pool without my head being submerged   the pool is 1 4 metres deep all the way around nice pool despite this finally the biggest concern for me was that i was there for 40 minutes and the health club in that time was not manned i was appalled because of the swimming pool and the dangers of children drowning  too bad no one was there to save you if you drowned also there are lockers but at the time i was there there was no keys for the lockers so you could use them i went to the desk and because it wasn t manned i couldn t get help the sauna was very nice i must admit  though it was not steaming when i was there  it was nice and hot   with the bvlgari pack you get you only get one soap bar bath salts and something else for one person  not for 2 people  we also didn t have bathrobes in our room so that was a bit sad finally the buffet breakfast is good  on the whole  the fruit was very sweet and nice  given the fact that it is winter in sydney  don t go at 10am  we had to queue for 10 minutes before getting a table i forgot to mention  the location is excellent  2 minutes walk from the airport train and circular quay loved the location of the hotel you pay for the location though walking distance to many things ,negative,5,0,1,2
this is the best out of all the five stars that i have stayed at in sydney this was the best by far the level of service was outstanding from check in through to dining room service had booked a room and was upgraded to a suite because it was my wife s birthday they have an executive lounge that you are given access to which has free coffee and drinks the staff in here went out of their way to make us feel welcome and could not do enough to help the room itself was very comfortable with magnificent views over sydney harbour and the opera house breakfast was very nice with an egg chef on hand to freshly prepare omelettes pancakes etc i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone ,positive,5,5,5,5
solid choice this is a typical american chain hotel everything working well nothing fancy we have chosen this hotel because they allow 2 adults plus 2 children in a room  not so common in sydney and because of the opera house view the surcharge for opera view was certainly worth it also because rooms on this side of the building are significantly larger than those towards city or bridge the marriott is in an excellent position for transportation  ferries trains buses and for business  post office in the same building and anz bank across the street for instance  the immediate area is of limited interest for tourists especially in the evening and during weekends when everything is closed darling harbour might be a better location for family vacations alpha cafe is in the same building and it offers quick bites at reasonable prices  for the area  friendly service too recommended for breakfast closed sunday one thing we particularly liked was the friendly maid service the maid always cleaned our room early in the morning so it was ready when the kids returned for a nap a few things could be improved the mattress was far too soft i dont quite understand their policy towards early arrivals they have the arrivals lounge which is a very generous gesture on the other hand they only started checking in people after 11am checkout process was in full swing when we arrived at 8am so it should be possible to have rooms ready a bit earlier    morning newspapers and turndown service should be standard at 5 star hotels at this marriott they are only available on request  windows can t be opened  ,positive,3,4,4,5

ok business hotel  not bad but you can do better having seen how highly this hotel scores on trip advisor i m left feeling that some other reviewers could have a career as wine critics   i travel a lot and stay in a lot of business hotels around asia this hotel doesn t cut it as a 5 star hotel it perhaps just scrapes through as a 4 star but more realistically it s a 3 and a half there is nothing dramatic to fault it s just old and tired and the service is hit  miss yes the rooms are clean and if you are lucky you get a good view of the harbour  the opera house  but you would also get this at any of the many highrise hotels at this end of town  and yes the location is good if you are a tourist or if you work at the north end of the cbd  otherwise only average  there is an avis desk with available cars at the hotel which is very convenient but the bathroom is small basic and dated a minimal update some time recently didn t really disguise this the air conditioning is noisy and still has a notveryaccurate dial on the wall as it s controller the furniture  fixtures show plenty of signs of a tough life no doubt if you stay here you will be comfortable enough but don t expect 5 star standard and for this money there are better options ,negative,0,0,2,2

wonderful stayed there in april on a special package deal offered by the hotel and advertised in the age newspaper it included a double room with city views breakfasts and free valet parking  unsually costly in the centre of sydney  we were given a room with a great views of the bridge and harbour which was wonderful the location is also great  a short walk to the rocks circular quay restaurants and the gardens our only complaints were that we were charged for one breakfast each day which was odd as there was two of us staying there this was quickly sorted at checkout and no charge was made to us another hiccup was the rudeness of the valet parking attendant who was very rude and condescending however the checkin and room staff were extremely helpful and friendly and professional overall i would certainly stay there again ,positive,0,5,5,5
not nearly worth the price i stayed here for 3 days it was extremely overpriced the rooms were alright the service was alright but they made me pay extra for internet in my room  when i paid full price for the room and even in the business center i was stuck on my floor for 15 mins waiting for an elevator to check out other than the location it was mediocre at best i ve stayed at places in sydney that had the same location pluses for much cheaper and have enjoyed my stay much more i will not be staying there again ,negative,3,0,1,4
fab stayed at this hotel for four nights and it was fab our room was on the 27th floor and we had a super view of the opera house excellent location near to circular quay the opera house the harbour bridge and the rockes staff were very friendly and conceige very helpful highly recommend the pancakes for breakfast had a meal in the hotel bar which was delicoius singer and guitarist were also very good only complaint wish the beds in our room were facing the other way as then we would have had a view from them of the opera house and beyond ,positive,5,5,5,5
a great experience in a great city stayed here on a reward for three nights after working in mascot this hotel was great  excellent service comfortable room  mine was on the 29th floor with a nice view of the opera house  good bar and restaurant with typical hotel prices  but the bar wasn t bad in that respect  get a bondi beauty especially if annica  sp is making it   it s so easy to get here and to get around  cityrail and sydney ferry both operate a block away i would love to stay here again next time i am in this great city ,positive,5,0,0,5
loved this place  i can t say enough about this place the location is fantastic the hotel is clean and the staff was great when we first arrived  after a very long series of flights which started in chicago over a day before  our room wasn t ready yet  it was only about 9am though so it s not their fault  they have a guest lounge w bathrooms that have private showers so we were able to get some of the airport grunge off of us so we could go out and explore until our room was ready which was really nice the concierge there was wonderful  they helped us get oriented they booked us concert tickets they booked us a tour and they were extremely nice while doing it all the rooms are lovely the bed was really comfy and we even lucked out and got a harbour bridge view from our room we would absolutely stay here again if and when we get back to australia ,positive,5,5,5,5
great location for sydney sightseeing stay at the marriott for 4 nights and experienced the madness excitement of new years eve albeit with serious jetlag   room had two double beds  2 adults 2 ten year olds and a very nice well laid out bathroom breakfast was delicious we were the jetlaggers who arrived as it opened at 7am each morning    kids loved the freshly made pancakes great choice ambience and service all round this hotel is in a prime position for sightseeing walking distance to opera house and botanic gardens also the rocks area which is amazing boats leaving regular from the quay for loads of places we went to manly beach which was lovely also got bus to bondi from nearby the hotel worth paying just for the location if you re on a short maybenevertoberepeated visit   cocktails in the lobby bar were great too  recommend  ,positive,5,5,5,5
horrible experience gave away my prepaid room room not ready prepaid executive room w view on exec floor and did not get my room for 4 adults so had to settle for small suite w one king bed and 2 roll away beds stuffed in this cramped room they simply gave away my room what a bunch of crap they knew i was prepaid and reserved for 3 mos before and should have had my room        since i prepaid they would not discount this lower grade roomthey were ultra busy   too busy to provide any type of quality service    sad we were so far away from home and had to put up w this from what i had previous thought was a quality hotel chainnever again will i trust marriott          and as for hotels com     their prepayment requirment sucks there are alot more hotels in this area to stay at and i would suggest one of them        ,negative,0,0,1,1

no reward points this is a terrible hotel the charges that they charge on your bill you have to scrutinizes it carefully because it doesn t tally at all the worst thing is about the rewards points if you are staying there with a third party paying you i would suggest you to stay in other hotels like radisson marriot don t give rewards points iof it is paid by 3rd party this is very frustrating because i choose marriot as i though i could be rewarded in fact i have colleagues staying in radisson and they ware rewarded with points i would never ask my agent to book this hotel again as this is a  nothing great hotel plus the services is not good either ,negative,0,0,1,2
great hotel in a great location we should mention we booked this hotel through priceline which gave us a fabulous deal of 150 night when regular rooms went for 300 night but while our rave review may be slightly enhanced due to our bargain i would still consider it a solid hotel choice even at full price the hotel definitely seems more geared towards business travelers but the location itself proves great for tourists and leisure travelers as well it is located only a short walk from the rocks and opera house as well as the ferries in the quay the concierge was very helpful without being snooty  as some concierges are nowadays and gave us some great restaurant recommendations  including one where i was inches away from david beckham    but that s a different story  we tried the breakfast buffet which was a bit pricey at 33 pp but was filling and had all the standard offerings one note of advice  check the taxi rates before coming i had looked at the marriott website and it said a cab ride from the airport was only 35 our cab ride ended up being 61 and we just thought the website was outdated later on we asked the concierge about it and they said that we were definitely overcharged and that their bellman should have noticed the price and had us refuse to pay i don t blame the bellman because he was very busy getting our luggage into the hotel but just know there are cab drivers out there that will screw you  if you know the right fare ahead of time you will be better prepared to dispute it ,positive,5,0,5,4
fantastic for a splurge this is a fantastic hotel i can t say one bad thing about it the room was spacious and luxurious the amenities were great the location can not be beat it is very close to the harbor and the sydney opera house and the spectacular bonatical gardens it is also very close to the subway we stayed for 4 nights and felt very welcome and safe it was a great way to see sydney for the first time it was a bit of a splurge for us but i figured how many times am i going to be in sydney at the end of our trip to australia we came back to sydney and stayed in a less expensive place on the other side of town my opinion  splurge   ,positive,5,0,5,0
good location average service overpriced we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on our pacific trip it was the most expensive hotel we stayed at on this trip even some 3star hotels in other countries were better than this one the hotel is in a good location which is the only positive about the hotel service quality was average and the room although clean was not adequate for its starrating they charge about 5 dollars for 15 minutes usage of the internet terminals  we could use internet terminals for free in honk kong and japan don t stay at this hotel unless you want to pay for its name ,negative,4,0,1,3
great location top quality marriott fantastic location just a few minutes walk from the ferries and bustleof circular key and 1o minutes to the rocks and bridge walk entrance and lobby is quite grand and the latter features an open bar area albeit at a cost but my guess is the patrons are mostly business travellers i arrived very early morning and was able to use a room with decent bathroom allocated for such folks the pool area was being refurbishedduring my stay which bodes well for the future however i phoned hotel just after booking to reserve a room that would not be shaken apart by this work but upon arrival there was no record of this arrangement i returned later in the day after a great time doing the harbour bridge walk to find i d been allocated a high room 2 room suite which was great news particularly as this was a freebie using marriott points everything in the room was excellent from linens to flat screen tvs main bathroom was fantastic very modern spacious complete with jacuzzi train station is just a 3 minute walk which will also get you without change to the airport the combined ferry train bus1 day pass is greatvalue making lunch at bondi beech and watching the sun set at milsons point ready options just made it into the 5 rating ,positive,5,5,5,5
central hotel stands up to the marriott reputation very centrally located to many tourist attractions like the rocks and the circular quay and the botanic gardens we were a little bummed that a majority of the guests seemed americanwas like we d travelled so far to be close to home so if you re looking for something where you ll be surrounded by australians this isn t it  though of course you probably wouldn t be looking at a marriott eh  it s a big hotel too so don t expect much personal service  though we did get to know the concierges who were very helpful  also the neighborhood seemed like sydney s equivalent to wall street which meant that things nearby were closed on the weekend and lots of characterless restaurants quite a nice gym ,positive,4,0,4,3
lovely hotel we stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in august we had no problems with the elevators at all  even though work was supposedly going on we had paid extra for an opera house view  the weather wasn t great so on balance i didn t think this worth the extra money the rooms are great and the breakfast was very nice the hotel bar was fine  although it closed at 11pm which was a little strange  although it is in the lobby so you can still sit there  the best thing about the hotel is it s location  you can walk to the opera house the rocks and lots of restaurants in about 5 minutes also the ferries trains and buses are only 2 minutes away as well ,positive,4,4,3,4
loved marriott at circular quay when they say marriott at circular quay they mean right on top of it you are 12 minutes from the circular quay hub to catch busses ferries and trains loved the location the rocks  with all the pubs and restaurants  opera house and pitt street shopping are only a 34 miniutes walk royal botanical gardens 45 minute walk loved the flying foxes by the way the staff was very friendly they let us check in early  thank you and have a late departure directions and suggestions seemed second nature to the staff wonderful room with the super comfy marriott beds little extra touches made it very special the only problem was that the elevators were being renovated but by the second day they had a staff member take you to the service elevators if the delays were too long i m sure they will be complete soon ,positive,5,0,5,5
great location stayed here for a week in early april loved the location walking distance to circular quay the rocks and pitt street shopping we even walked to darling harbour about 15 minutes away the staff was promt and had our room ready when we arrived at 730am after a long international flight the only problem was the elevators where being renovated and only two out of five where operating this made for some slow and crowded elevators particularly if you re up in the upper floors where the rooms with the view are located i would stay here again but check for full elevator operation ,positive,5,0,0,4
great rooms bad service stayed here for 3 nights in march the room we got was great view of the opera house an old englishstyle building good furnishings  except a little wear and tear showing on the bathroom ceiling  the hotel s location is pretty good too but the service was really lacking i was staying with a friend who didn t have a credit card and didn t speak that much english but would arrive at the hotel several hours before me i called the hotel a week early to tell them the situation gave them my credit card and gave them my marriott rewards number  i m  silver elite in their book  i then called them again about 3 days before my stay asking some logistical questions about getting to the hotel and asked them again if my credit card marriott rewards number were on file they said no and took them down again promising that there would be no problems for my friend to check in when my friend arrive to check in they treated her horribly they denied having the credit card forced to put up a hefty cash deposit barred her from making phone calls from the room etc etc when i showed up and told the front desk what happened they were unsympathetic and the thing that really gets me is that they had my marriott rewards number on file that means that someone did get the credit card number over the phone but that they lost ittwice   of course i need to watch my credit card number very carefully for fraud now all in all we made the most of our stay enjoyed sydney and the room and avoided the front desk like the plague we checked into the grace hotel a few blocks away a few days later and had far better service and more modern room  with a worse view  ,negative,4,0,3,1
a fine hotel we stayed only one night here upon arrival in sydney  we would have stayed more nights but every decent hotel in sydney was booked for our duration there  arrived around 10 am and no room was ready yet but hotel graciously provided an early arrivals room for others like us it s a room they converted into a waiting area with candy shower toilet free internetconnected computer couches this made the wait fairly painless after the long flight the room was standard businesstraveler  perfectly fine the hotel s main strength is its outstanding location so close to sydney s best attractions just minutes walk to opera house botanic garden rocks etc wish we could have stayed more nights here ,positive,5,0,4,5

3 stars maybe 5 stars definitely not i have not stayed in a hotel that was more undeserving of its rating there is nothing 5star about the accommodations appearance and service associated with this hotel my wife and i had reserved a club room with harbor view the room was very small and cramped and had a view facing the city opposite the harbor they made us wait til the following day to switch rooms and when they did switch us they switched us to another room with an almost identical view of the city at that point we just accepted the room the concierge staff was hit or miss one of the gentleman was genuinely helpful the other two we interacted with seemed aloof and apathetic probably the most annoying thing about the entire stay is the elevators i don t know how or why but there are 5 elevators in the hotel each time we attempted to ascend or descend the wait for an elevator was unbelievably long i am not sure why this was but it was strange other random notes the food was descent the workout facilities were acceptable the spa massage area was cold and sterile if you can get a good price on this hotel and book accommodations with expectations of a 3star property i d recommend it if you are expecting a true 5star experience i d keep looking ,negative,0,3,1,2
perfect location   this hotel couldn t be in a better location walking distance to the opera house royal botanical garden qvb the rocks and circular quay ferry train and bus station the staff was accomodating and the concierge was very helpful the only complaint i have is the restaurant in the hotel icons incredibly overpriced my friend and i had a steak dinner it took over one hour for our steaks to get to us they were over cooked and they not once refilled our water the meal cost us over 100 and we had no alcohol another morning we thought we would try a quick breakfast the buffet costs 32 so we opted for the menu it took 15 minutes for them to take our order and my bowl of special k cost 6 50 toast 6 50 the kicker was when i saw the waitresses obtaining some of the food people were ordering off of the menu from the buffet our overall experience with the hotel was excellent but avoid the restaurant at all costs    ,negative,5,1,1,3

this hotel is a zoo the only great thing about this hotel  and it is amazing  is the location it is literally a stone s throw from the main ferries and the transportation area i chose this hotel because we were arriving  10a internationally with two small children and they have an early arrival lounge the whole hotel is packeda complete zoo elevators full eartoear long lines to talk to the front desk etc  the early arrival lounge is a joke  a vinyl couch with three people on it and a jar of mentos one bathroom with the single toilet and shower inside i emailed the conceirge twice before departure asking for an early check in because of the kids and they still could not swing it we were forced to riffle through our bags in front of everyone in the lounge and shower change or lose our first whole day in sydney the actual rooms are very cramped and nothing great but adequate the buffet breakfast is beautiful we also stayed at the shangri la and it was twice as nice and less expensive although a little farther walk from the ferries also received my invoice back in the states and a few extra charges appeared on my bill which has not been easy to retify ,negative,5,4,2,3
a great citibreak hotel we stayed for two nights great location close to the rocks circular quay etc get a room on an upper floor we had a great view over the harbour bridge the rooms are of a comfortable standard but not large the only thing that annoyed was the aus7 for a bottle of water in the room i dont care how many stars  thats a joke in summary an excellent standard hotel in a great location for accessing the harbour and city attractions  the perfect citibreak hotel ,positive,5,0,2,5
must try harder  having stayed at other marriot in sydney and brisbane i was a little disapointed with the harbour marriott the plus first though the location is fantastic  just across the road from cicular quay however we did feel that this hotel is almost too big we had neumerous problems with contacing  at your service  we reqested a sydney telegraph daily but this request was not met and we were told could not be as the hotel did not stock this local paper yet they could get international papers  the bed was very uncomfortable and hard and the bath room in particular was very small the staff we found were not particulary freindly either  this is in comparison to other marriott  but we spent very little time in the hotel and it certainly was a clean hotel and felt very safe it is however expensive and if you do nt mind a bit of a walk i would recomend the sydney marriott on hyde park out of the 2 marriott in central sydney  ,negative,5,0,2,2

the best location in sydney i absolutely loved the sydney marriott harbour the best location right by circular quay the rocks the hotel have beautiful rooms very friendly service and a convenient business center we used the internet every day to stay in touch at home we ate breakfast at the hotel in the morning very good food and a good price i loved everything about the service i received and the room i booked very comfortable beds i want to go back and if i do i will only stay at this hotel ,positive,5,5,5,5
a well situated hotel we stayed 2 nights it is possibly the best situated tourist hotel in sydney and it certainly has some views of the opera house and the harbour bridge  but possibly not both we possibly got upgraded because we had a good view of the opera house  thanks for that the hotel has a branch of avis in the forecourt and the main reason we chose the hotel in the first place was that we knew where it was and that there was an avis branch where we could leave our hired car without searching the city the theory worked and we disposed of the car without any problems the hotel was very good and our room was of more than adequate size and very well appointed breakfast was included in our rate and was good without being over extensive or particularly memorable but the hot things were actually hot and that is a bonus these days the service  i e coffee supplier was good and we were cheerfully supplied with more coffee when we asked for it the concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable when we left we were offered a limousine to the airport at the same price as a taxi  40 and we accepted  it was a good decision we enjoyed our stay and would thoroughly recommend the hotel ,positive,5,4,5,5
great location for first time visitor we stayed in the marriot for 7 nights from 31st dec yes we were there for the new years party the hotel is located 3 mins walk from circular quay and on the edge of the rocks so 1015 mins walk from the bridge and opera house where you can get the underground the hotel room was excellent with a view of the bridge it was clean and well maintained and a nice sized bath with integral shower the staff were very professional and helpful with our sightseeing requests and expecially when we had an issue with our transfer  provided by another company which they chased up to get our time of collection for first time visitors and families i would heartily recommend this hotel for singles or young couples i would suggest also looking at other areas since apart from the circular quay the area seems to be rather quite  and expensive in the evenings and very tourist orientated for example we spent an evening in darlinghurst which seemed to have character and feel more friendly ,positive,5,5,5,5
no worries mate i had to stay here for a week and overall thought it was a great hotel the room had  the view over the harbour the staff were pleasant and helpful breakfasts were the usual  international stuff but don t bother eating dinner here   for the price they charge there s much better local options at the rocks ,positive,4,2,4,4
small rooms old there is better value in sydney we did not like the hotel at all we would give it 3 1 2 at max the entrance area might be impressive and location is great but rooms were old and not up to date we felt like travelling in the early 90s we think there is better value for equivalent rates for example the quay west suites ,negative,4,0,2,1

can t wait to get out imagine having to remind the room service about the order after waiting for an hour and having to wait 15 minutes for the elevators  although there were 5   well stay here if you do not mind such level of service and if you have lotsa money to burn i was glad i changed to another hotel midway ,negative,0,0,1,1
worth a few extra  stayed at this property on two separate visits for a total of 7 nights paid for the upgrade to the executive floor as well for au110 per night every single staff member at the hotel was great to work with everyone was very friendly and extremely helpful when we checkedin around 1130am there was no line and we were able to go directly to our room from what i have seen and heard the executive level rooms are the same as the regular rooms except they get turndown service and 2x daily housekeeping speaking of housekeeping they cleaned our room everday in the 45 minutes that we were at breakfast executive floor lounge was nice breakfast food was great evening food service was hit or miss but i don t think that many people were trying to make a meal of it the bellmen were extremely attentive when we needed baggage picked up  delivered on a couple of occassions they walked off before we could give them a tip the coincierge desk was a great tool as well i dealt with scott and he helped me out a ton i also dealt with another coincierge on scott s day off we were trying to find a casual restaurant for dinner on sunday when most restaurants are closed the other coincierge was trying to point us to places with 4050 entrees went to the rocks cafe instead for a great meal at a cheaper price on to the hotel services   in my opinion the minibar prices and most of the room services prices weren t all that bad you would be hard pressed to find meals at local restaurants for the prices offered the restaurant onsite seemed like it charged about a 5 premium which isn t terrible the place to avoid though is the spa gym prices were beyond sky high laundry services were also outrageously priced all in all though the best marriott property that i have stayed in the staff really made all of the difference ,positive,5,5,4,5
enjoyed our stay my family and i stayed here upon our arrival to sydney from sfo and again on our way home back to the states we were pleasantly suprised when a room was available for early check in  we were expecting to be offered the early arrival room  the double room was rather small but very clean and comfortable city and bridge view especially nice at night we had breakfast in the executive club lounge lounge access was provided with my husband s marriott gold status breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs sausage bacon toast fruit cereal and pastry nice deserts in the evening we didn t take advantage of room service because the menu was a little pricey i had planned on using the health club but i chose to be a lazy girl instead my husband niece and nephew enjoyed playing in the pool and hot tub our second stay at the marriott prior to returning home was equally comfortable if i were to return to sydney again i would stay here the staff is very friendly and they go all out to make you feel like happy campers ,positive,4,5,4,4
great location great location  just one block out of circular quay walking distance to the opera house sydney harbour bridge and the rocks it was easy to find breakfast on a weekday since it was in the financial district we walked to the rocks most evenings for dinner good access to city buses and the train the room was a good size for a city hotel but nothing spectacular to write about the concierge was very helpful in selecting tours and restaurants on our next visit i would probably consider staying in the rocks  that neighborhood has much more character ,positive,4,0,0,4
unmade room at 5pm i stayed the sydney harbour marriott hotel on business trips in march 2004 and also recently for 5 nights in may 2005 i thought that the checkin service was fine the staff were friendly staff and helpful i had a king sized bed with a blanket which was too warm so i had to turn the airconditioning on pretty strong the bathroom was clean i ordered room service twice once it was delivered in 45 minutes and once it was delivered in 15 minutes my boss who was travelling with me complained that her room had not been made up at 5pm maybe we ve been spoiled by hotels in asia that have more than enough staff to make up your room twice a day but 5pm and an unmade room is not acceptable they also forgot to give me an opportunity to review my bill before i paid for it which in my opinion is totally unacceptable however the location is excellent and i had a nice view of the opera house ,negative,4,0,1,2
location location stayed at shm early april for two nights absolutely brilliant location as another reviewer noted though hotel lacks a little character and is perhaps somewhat sterile but rooms were first class and bed extremely comfortable dined in on first evening and meal was excellent with well researched wine list providing many highly drinkable aussie vintages didn t bother with hotel breakfast as found small cafe right next to hotel that provided good english american breakfast for only a few dollars walked to most sights of interest even walked from oxford st paddington back to hotel paddington is an old very interesting inner suburb with chic shops and delightful terraced houses lovely stroll back through beautiful hyde park  reminiscent of londons parks  it is many years since my wife and i last visited sydney and it is still a fascinating and delightful place to visit the marriot being so close to the magnificent harbour and surrounds made it just that much more enjoyable an absolute must is to visit the cocktail bar on the 36th floor of the shangri la hotel  a city block away from shm  we arrived just before sunset and had amazing views of sun setting through one set of windows and rush hour traffic crossing sydney harbour bridge directly below us through another set of huge glass windows must be one of the most spectacular city sights anywhere in the world enjoy your stay at shm we certainly did  ,positive,5,4,5,5
great hotel shame about the staff we stayed at the sydney harbour marriott for a few days in march booked using marriott reward points for 4 nights closer to the trip we added an extra night but explained that we wouldn t be arriving until early the next morning  landed at about 6 am and wanted to get straight into our room after the long trip from the uk  got to the hotel and the fact that we had booked for one night and were only just arriving caused them no end of confusion we had phone messages every day because they couldn t find the reservation with the points on on one occasion they also couldn t manage to switch off the message light so we had this flashing all night  or until we unplugged the phone  other than fairly useless staff you could have been in any big chain hotel anywhere in the world it was clean comfortable and characterless but we only wanted a city base so weren t bothered about that wouldn t bother paying the upgrade charge for the harbour view i imagined a glorious view of the whole sweep of sydney harbour with the opera house what we got was a view of the opera house in between other tower blocks  really not worth bothering with didn t have brekkie included in the deal and there are loads of places you can get a good breakfast for half the price of the marriott don t bother paying for brekkie unless you really want to pig out at the buffet i would class this as a characterless hotel great location and okay as a central base for exploring sydney ,negative,5,1,1,1
like fawlty towers from the moment we arrived  when noone bothered to take our bags from the taxi to the moment we left there was nothing but hassles our booking  made 3 months prior was incorrect as they had us staying for one night not two and then told us we would have to move rooms during our stay despite breakfast being inclusive it was placed on our bill  despite checking with reception and with the restaurant we were overcharged in the bar and when this was pointed out were told nothing could be done about it    they soon got the message  staff seemed totally inept even checkout took 20 minutes due to a long queue at the reception desk complaints fell on deaf ears nice hotel great location dreadful service  ,negative,4,1,1,1
sydney harbor marriott worked out great we stayed at the sydney harbor marriott between december 28 and january 2 2005 we booked our reservation almost a year in advance because we wanted to use reward points and we wanted to have the new year s eve experience at the opera house our room was of course free with points but we paid out of pocket 110us night to upgrade to a suite facing the opera house and it was definitely worth it granted i certainly cannot complain about the hotel since the majority of the cost was free but even if we had paid full price it was a lovely place to stay the room was very clean and attractively decorated  though the suite is not large as suites go  the hotel  as many of the large hotels is very conveniently located to the key tourist areas a starbucks is right across the way an avis branch is located in the hotel which made things very convenient for taking a trip to the blue mountains the service from the staff was quite good as well make sure to have access to the concierge level the alcohol was free and the hor d oeurves spread was more than enough for a dinner if you did not want to go out there was a wide selection of foods offered both in the evening and in the morning for breakfast new year s eve was everything i had hoped it would be we had gotten tickets online for the actual nye performance in the opera house and we could view the fireworks from viewing platforms in the opera house so we did not have to deal with the throngs of people jockeying for position although our marriott room had a direct view of the harbor you would not want to stay in your hotel while this worldreknown visual extravaganza is going on unfortunately for them some people thought that would be the best way to enjoy the fireworks it was said that the harbor had 1 5 million people viewing the fireworks and it probably did but the crowd was so happy and well behaved  no alcohol can be brought in that i felt very comfortable and safe  and would have felt safe walking back to the hotel without my husband had i needed to marriott is not the four seasons but then again they don t charge like them either it was a perfect place to land for 5 days and i would definitely stay there again ,positive,5,5,5,5
thoroughly enjoyed the marriott sydney harbour for our getaway weekend in sydney with friends from brisbane qld we chose the marriott sydney harbour after browsing through just about every hotel around the sydney cbd listed in the internet we wanted somewhere that would enhance our stay and felt that the reviews of this hotel could meet our numerous and rather demanding expectections from the moment we set foot into the hotel we were plesantly surprised by the beautifully appointed interiors but more importantly by the very generous and friendly staff only too ready to help what impressed me most was the incentive and flexibility each staff member showed in handling the different situations congratulations to everyone working there and keep up the great work i must also say a big thankyou to the baggage handlers for their quick action in ringing us up soon after we departed in a taxi to inform us we left a camera behind thankyou guys we ll definately be back next time we are in town p s location location location  you couldnt get closer to the busses ferries and trains the harbour bridge view was great from our room slept like a log in the king bed and breakie was well laid out  downside was we ate too much  ,positive,5,5,5,5

a poke in the eye for the best western chain hmmm where do i start well how about the main reception area is staffed but that is it the other areas are sparse for staff reception staff reminded me of a monty python skit about to start rooms were ok fairly clean but def not thoroughly we found someone else s food in our fridge yuk     cleaning staff were not consistent never knew when they were coming if at all guess you could label them reactive rather than proactive they have a coffee shop adjacent to their lobby but it closes way too early you have to go out and walk a ways to get something to eat or drink now having said the above stuff it is very close to many attractions bus stops and touristy areas close to banks and post office would we stay there again i doubt it we found many other alternatives later on that made stellar not so stellar ok in a pinch but shop around ,negative,4,0,2,1
beware of elevator noise in some rooms    and thin walls we ve actually stayed in this hotel twice this year it has a great location is very clean and all round could be such a great place   if it wasn t for that elevator this time we spent a sleepless first night on the 6th floor and the noise from the elevator was unbelievable due to the hotel s location guests obviously come and go a lot and late at night which shouldn t be a problem  but if the elevator makes this whooshing sound every time it moves believe me it can drive you insane the next morning the staff was very helpful to give us another room on the third floor  where we still heard the elevator but it was better i noticed another reviewer mentioned the lift noise before me and the hotel management replied that the problem of intermittent noise from the elevator would be fixed by september  08 as of end of november this obviously was not the case generally the walls in this hotel are thin and you will hear your neighbors conversations and every time the  heavy bathroom doors slam shut due to the noise problems we will not stay in this hotel again  a shame really because otherwise it has all the ingredients to be a nice little hotel ,negative,5,0,0,5
noisy hotel sketchy area very disappointed with my stay here read the reviews and thought this was a safe bet i must have missed the review which mentioned the night club below reception paper thin walls and floor ceilings i have been listening to the 4  guys in the next room getting ready to go out for 1 hour now i thought the rate was okay for sydney but i would pay more to stay in a more upscale hotel location is good if you want easy access to the dodgy party district not great if you are simply a tourist who wants to feel safe walking around the streets and have easy access to the opera house harbour rocks etc ,negative,1,0,3,1
good stuff this hotel surpassed my expectations perhaps it was the fact that they upgraded us for free but the room we got was the largest hotel room i ve ever been in also we d requested to be put on a high floor so they put us on the top floor with a view of the park sweet the bed was kingsized and comfy there was a kitchen and minibar and the bathroom was huge nice complimentary toiletries in the bathroom although unfortunately there was no free moisturiser can t have everything i guess especially when it s so reasonably priced also nice was the hotel happy hour they have two for one drinks every day from 57pm the location of the hotel was really convenient so we could have a couple of drinks and then head out to dinner somewhere i d highly recommend this hotel ,positive,5,5,5,5
noisy lift we booked the hotel stellar after reading good reviews when we arrived we had been put right next to the lift which makes a terrible noise and can be heard through the walls i had requested a quiet room in my email when booking it would be obvious to anyone that this was not a quiet room as they were fully booked we had to find another hotel to stay at we booked weeks in advance and so were disappointed that they had not taken into account my request for a quiet room on the plus side the staff were helpful and polite when we cancelled our stay ,negative,0,0,0,5
great stay in sydney centre we were so happy we chose this hotel after reading the reviews here on tripadvisor the first impression from the outside and the reception was a little bit disappointing but when we walked into the room we were so surprised as it was very spacious modern immaculately clean with a very comfortable and huge bed and a light and big bathroom it was a great place to get back to after a long day of sightseeing tip the breakfast in the caf adjoining the hotel is fantastic and great value for money ,positive,4,0,5,4
lots of character a great location to visit sydney from   a somewhat reno d hotel that had all the comforts of home a small kitchen a great shower and three twin beds we stayed in a triple on the top  6th floor near the elevator this way the only complaint we could make during our stay the noise from the elevator was enough to wake us in the morning we didn t go to bed early enough for it to be a problem in the evening even with our room facing the street there was very little street noise the lift seemed to be really the only issue i think that being at the top floor may have been the reason   the staff were great they looked after our bags when we arrived early before checkin they helped contact tour companies and taxis and they locked up our bags when we had a late flight out they were great bartenders at happy hour just allround more than eager to please the internet was very reasonably priced and lots of terminals there is a coffee shop next door so during the week the customers of the coffee shop use the internet as well still seems to be enough for all coffee shop is closed on sunday  we enjoyed the fact that it was a little bit older and seemed to have a bit of character to it its a small personable place where the staff make you feel appreciated ,positive,5,0,4,5

loved this small hotel we travelled to australia in november 2007 from canada and stayed 4 nights at the best western hotel stellar in sydney prior to taking the 28day around australia cruise we had read the reviews on trip advisor and can only add that they were accurate the stellar is a very well appointed small boutique hotel centrally located  we could walk downtown sydney in 20 minutes near bus stops walking distance to railway station  train to airport and restaurants the rooms are spacious with kitchenette which we didn t need but it would be a good feature for someone staying longer the bathroom were all marble and tiles and quite large the room and bathroom were very clean and new looking the staff was very helpful and courteous there is a locker room off the lobby for storing luggage if needed and reasonably priced internet access in the lobby a small cafeteria adjacent to the lobby  not own by the hotel was excellent for a light breakfast lovely very reasonably priced small hotel that we would recommend highly a winner in a city that is rather expensive otherwise ,positive,5,0,4,5
nice hotel my husband and i spent two nights at the hotel stellar in sydney the location was in between the airport and the main attractions of sydney the harbor opera house were within walking distance for those who are able to walk i would say the walk is about 6 miles to the main attractions of sydney the hotel was clean nice and the staff was friendly we experienced rain while we were there and the hotel offered us free umbrellas for our use there was no restaurant at the hotel but there was a cafe attached to the hotel and the food was good i would recommend the hotel and would stay at the hotel again vic  ,positive,5,4,4,4
unbelievably insulting concierge   hotel was conveniently located we stayed for 8 days hall way constantly smelt of urine rooms were newly refurbished and hence excellent showers were however far too weak the whole stay was ruined by a remarkable incident on the last day when we had returned to pick up our luggage  we checked out a m   the receptionist pavol when i requested to have our luggage back held up a miniture bottle of whiskey and asked me to explain it  it had been emptied and clear liquid put in its place  i understood the implication and told him that it was nt us and that we had nt used the mini bar at all during our stay to my astonishment he repeated the accusation at this point i took exception and again repeated that we didnt touch the mini bar and that his insistance was rude and offensive at this point i thought he would back down but amazingly in very sarcastic tones he repeated the accusation   well at 45 years old  and having travelled extensivley with business and pleasure and also being in the customer service business i was astounded at the audacity of pavol i confess that i got very angry and shouted at him that  having paid over 2800 to settle my bill would i really want to cheat them out of 5 also surely i would of done a better job and put tea colour liquid in the bottle my taxi came and i left shaking with anger we had spent three weeks in sydney and  up to that point  had had an excellent experience what a great shame i have written twice to the hotel but i suspect that my letters are being intercepted as i have still not received a reply from hte general manager a reply has come back and they say that pavol has been a long standing and good employee i leave you to draw your own conclusions i think this hotel relies on its location for its business i certainly dont think its due to its customer care thankyou ,negative,4,0,1,1

overall a fun stay if you d like to be right in the action in tourist central i was in town for business this was a good place to stay if you want to be right in the middle of the action on hollywood boulevard and by action i mean being able to step outside your hotel and be accosted by daffy duck or spiderman or pocahontas etc and have shops right at your door the hotel is opposite the chinese theatre so also puts you somewhere easily reminiscable when watching films as you ll frequently see both the hotel and vicinity on tv and in films there are a lot of bands and celebrities who stay here so this is another level of action that you may seek out after getting the chance to drive around lots and see different areas i reckon next time i ll probably rent an apartment by the beach i tend to prefer more low key quiet chilled places with walking potential and if this strikes a similar chord this hotel may not be for you anyway the hotel itself was made up of a gorgeous exterior and the same if somewhat dark interior something i ve noticed popular in celebrity haunts  all the better not to see you with my dear  the pool is legendary the rooms okay clean a modern take on the 70 s but as they are somewhat small and as the mattress sat in the middle of a larger wooden platform i kept bashing my shins on the corners every time i would walk around it i still have the scars so this was somewhat annoying good desk smallish window dark bathroom with not much light but all in all it was okay meals there very pricey breakfast oatmeal fruit and tea plus tip set me back over 45 i couldn t relax very well in the rooms though and i still don t really know why there was nothing really wrong with it and a great walk in closet if you re staying there for a while as i was some say the hotel is haunted who knows ,positive,4,2,0,4

disappointed w the roosevelt i was looking forward to my stay at the roosevelt for a business conference i was attending the location on hollywood blvd  is ideal with plenty going on around the hotel the room they initially gave me had an interesting style  an urban efficiency apartment feel to it as i walked through  intentionally dimly lit hallways with carpeting that mimmicked a brick road the room had a brick wall interior  still dimly lit by design  hardwood floors and a pavement like  concrete floor in the bathroom the problem was the noise there wasn t necessarily that much noise but because of the  extremely poor soundproofing of the rooms    you could hear very clearly every detail of the conversations in the rooms next to you it was as if you were sharing a cabin with people you didn t know when i called the front desk to ask to have my room changed   they  played naive about it but i sensed this was a common complaint with guests in that they quickly ended the charade and gave me a more conventional room in a different section of the building that room was indeed quieter but very very small personally i m alright with that when i opened the door and walked into the new room there were two staff members  not housecleaning that had shocked looks on their faces  guilty looks  they immediately hung up the room phone and bolted out of my room i was kind of ticked and called to make sure there were no charges against my room bill because there was limited shelf space and closet space the housekeeping crew accidently knocked my shaving kit into the toilet when they were cleaning rather than fess up to it they quietyly put it back in it s original location that evening when i got back to the room i reached in and noticed the thing was saturated with all of my toiletries wet  and items saturated there was construction going on on the  street lobby level so guests needed to take the  only one operating elevator down to the ground level and hike back up a set steps to get outside i know each of these issues sound minor and random but my general feeling is that for the price they charge per room you should expect good customer service and attention to details at a minimum a reasonably quiet room would seem like a fair expectation i wouldn t recommend the roosevelt   not for the prices they charge i m probably going to try the renaissance the next time i m in the area i don t expect everything to be perfect  i just want a clean and quiet room to stay in with minimal interruptions i did not get that ,negative,4,0,0,2
the roosevelt has it all covered i had the pleasure staying at the hollywood roosevelt last month for a long weekend i found that the hotel had all aspects of a hip and fun yet luxurious hotel covered having an aversion to anything pretentious being a fan of historic buildings and given the amentities within the hotel    i was tempted to never leave from the super comfortable bed and linens kiehls bath products  to the pool restaurants and bars not to mention the helpful attentive staff the allure and ambiance of the lobby alone makes you want to stay when i did leave the location is unbeatable right on hollywood blvd with so much within walking distance or a short drive  taxi ride away kudos to staff and management for dialing it all in and creating a wonderful experience i will definitely be returning to the hollywood roosevelt when i am in l a ,positive,5,5,4,5
good location and staff comfortable rooms fantastic location  right on walk of fame cattycorner from the chinese theatre lots of shopping rooms are small but comfortable and well furnished staff very friendly and helpful  it is california afterall  great burger bar on site  lots of cool combos so you can still clog your atteries with even if you go with the turkey or veggie options the atmosphere of the roosevelt is a bit dark  qualifies as cool in the evenings but in the morning dim lighting and techno music is a bit out of place jarring  but that s only a minor issue one random extra i loved  instead of the usual usa today outside your door in the morning you get a ny times just the thing for the coffee shop across the street from the hotel ,positive,4,4,0,4
location atmosphere service its all here stayed 4 nights from oct 4th with 3 adult children and 1 teenager bathroom small and with no exhaust system became quite steamy but loved the keihl products water pressure great soft luxurious towels room had two amazingly comfortable queen beds with enough room for 3 of us  other 2 had own room  4th floor room 414 i think not much of a view looked over rooftop if we hadn t been quite so tired had just flown in from australia we may have asked for better view but once we settled couldn t be bothered although i m sure they would have accommodated us not dark and dingy as made out in some reviews contemporary in design have read reviews of snooty staff this was not what we found at all check in was smooth initially given room with only one bed but was rectified immediately my children went to the bars in hotel we brought various food and drink back and had no problem with security at any stage during our stay as other reviewers have complained about a movie was being filmed one day of our stay with an enormous amount of equipment but this did not affect us at all concierge  lauren i think was helpful in organising limo and with any questions we had lobby near main entrance is really old world hollywood and just beautiful yes it is dark but that is part of its charm location can t be beat right on hollywood blvd across from graumans  felt safe in this area at night as long as you don t go more than about 5 blocks down although my children didn t worry at all and even walked to sunset at night probably not for young children or budget conscious but we loved it ,positive,4,4,3,4

good hotel great location we are a couple in our twenties and were pleased with our choice of the hollywood roosevelt for a twonight visit the location is perfect for exploring hollywood as it s right opposite the chinese theatre the rooms are very small but nicely done for a two night visit the room size wasn t a problem but it might be an issue if you re planning a longer visit the bathroom was lovely too with a good supply of products by  fresh  the hotel itself is very dark but that s part of its ambience the reception was lovely and the concierge very helpful we asked the concierge to book us tickets to the police who were playing at the bowl that evening  she sorted it all out for us while we went out sightseeing and our booking confirmation was under our door when we got in  although she did spend slighty more than we d agreed  on our first evening at the hotel there was a pool party which looked fun but a bit overwhelming after a long day travelling  it was packed full of local rich kids with music from a live dj the pool area is lovely during the day unfortunately we didn t have enough time to make the most of it we ate in the restaurant once and found the service very impressive the food was lovely although there was not a great choice for my boyfriend who is vegetarian the breakfast place within the hotel is very good too during our stay there was a limited lift service which was annoying as it meant a long wait each time but i m sure that was just temporary despite the hotel being rather pricey its a great place to stay to be in the heart of things ,positive,4,4,2,5

liked the hotel but reception staff were a bit dizzy recently stayed at the crowne plaza for 4 nights with husband and 8 month old baby we were part of a large group and had 7 rooms booked at the hotel we arrived and booked in but this took a while as the receptionist didn t really know what she was doing eventually we got checked in and went to our rooms reception also misadvised 2 of our party and said they were only booked in for 3 days instead of 4 which was incorrect but did cause us to worry the room was clean and tidy and had a large very comfortable bed the rooms were quiet and dark and we had a good view  we were on the 9th floor the room also had tea coffee facilities which was great for us to warm bottles baby food breakfast was buffet style or you could order off the menu the food was tasty and they had a good selection also they were accomodating for babies and had high chairs available hotel is well placed in beverly hills and was just a short walk to supermarket bars and restaurants and is close to rodeo drive felt safe walking round in the evening spoke to the concierge to book a trip to see stars homes etc  and we got a really good deal as there were 13 adults and 2 infants we were able to hire our own mini bus to take us to all the major sights and we could stop when we wanted to take photos we also booked the minibus to take us to and from universal studios and to the aurport which worked out much cheaper than using standard taxis would stay at this hotel again as it is very clean and comfortable and in a great location they just need to train their reception staff a bit better ,positive,4,4,4,4
not what you expect stayed at the crowne for 6 nights just because it is in beverly hills does not mean it is top of the line the rooms were very small the bathroom was rediculously small  take one step in turn around and sit on toilet step in shower or wash hands prison cells are bigger than this  staff was very pleasant and helpful bartender not very friendly plenty of sitting space in lounge and check in area we stayed on the 8th floor which included a small refrigerator  nice admenity  ,negative,3,0,0,2
very pleasant hotel the hotel is conveniently located the rooms are big with all what you need for a confortable stay including this dream box for relax that crowne plaza has on all their rooms conveniently located minutes ago from teathers shopping malls and all the action you might look for in beverly hills staff is friendly and they have a nice self parking lot i really have very good memories of this hotel that will be a good option for my next trip to beverly hills  ,positive,4,0,0,4
don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,negative,4,0,1,1
abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,negative,0,0,0,1
it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,negative,0,3,2,0
don t waste your money i would not recommend this hotel to anyone the pictures on the website were very disceiving i felt sick to my stomach when we arrived to the hotel itself when we fianally got to our room  via stairs i wanted to immediatly go elsewhere it was horrible inside we spent as much time as possible away from the place it was in a bad location and the people working the desk well that was a whole different matter if you are afraid of filthy places do not stay there       ,negative,1,0,0,2
our clothes were stolen we stayed in the hotel royal and got a room in the attic  very oddly designed and quite a walk up one day we got stuck in a typical new orleans downpour and we left our clothes to dry in the bathroom when we got back to our room not only were those clothes missing  but other accessories had been taken from the bathroom  a belt tie bath products and the front desk staff didn t do a thing about it i would never stay here ever again ,negative,0,0,0,1
awful just awful lemme tell ya  i want to know who their photographer is because i m sure he can make me look like marilyn monroe talk about making a dog look good   the rooms are nothing like what s pictured on the website there was a hole in the ceiling above the bed with crumbled plaster on the bedspread the jacuzzi suite was a jetted tub not the jacuzzi described furniture was not contemporary chic as it appears in the photos  it was just cheap and tacky cigarette butts and other trash were in the fountain in the weedy courtyard desk clerk was eating her lunch when we came in she never paused except to take a personal cell call she never paused either long enough to answer questions but continued as if we were an afterthought we canceled our stay and walked up the street to another hotel ,negative,0,0,0,1
do not stay at the hotel royal a group of stayed at this hotel for a family get together and it was an awful place the front desk individuals are for the most part unprofessional and unhelpful the rooms are filthy   unsanitary to say the least the towels were always stained dirty and they the sheets did not fit on the bed there were no bathroom toiletries  except for soap available and the water never got hot in the shower the balcony suites consisted of a window going out to a balcony that was about to fall off the side of the building   what a sham we were never able to sleep in past 7 am because of the noise on the street and coming from other rooms this was a huge disappointment you do not feel safe at the hotel and arrive home unrested and wanting to sanitize everything in your suitcase try somewhere else   you will be very unhappy here no matter what your standards are ,negative,0,0,0,2
this place is a total ripoff i cancelled my reservation to this hotel on october 1st and asked for my deposit back they told me i would have to talk to the manager susan smith because she s the only one who handles refunds that in itself seemed odd to me anyway i called her office almost every day since the 1st but she was never there i left countless messages with my phone number but she never called me back it s been over two weeks now and i ve spent lots of money on long distance calls but the hotel still owes me 223 74 deposit on two rooms i threatened to complain to the better business bureau but it did no good i guess they don t care about customer service i m just really glad i didn t actually stay at this hotel what horrible service   never stay at a hotel that requires a deposit on the room as you may never get it back if you cancel ,negative,0,0,1,1
shared similar experience with  junior suite as an earlier post stated i too was upgraded to the junior suite believe me there ain t nothing sweet about it my problems began in room 4 in the rear building the walls were filthy handprints smudges and god knows what else the windows were flush with the ceiling so no chance of seeing out the blinds were ready to fall out of one window the headboard had an inch of dirt on top the walls of the bathroom were covered in dust no closet space to speakof other than a homemade armoire 3x3x3 then the upgrade 6 flights of stairs from ground level   carpet on the last two flights was covered in dust than no one bothered to vacum an earlier post gave an accurate description of the room and its condition the continental breakfast were pastries straight out of wal mart packages the same stale pastries for 4 days why they don t have an arrangemnt with the pastierre around the corner is beyond me the front desk folks tried the best they could to make it a better stay but to no avail peter  the day clerk was the most helpful understanding person i have encountered yet if you do book a room ask for a courtyard room the showers are smaller than most broom closets but the rooms are great ,negative,0,0,0,2

acceptable the sofitel is probably hit or miss and for me it was a miss the hotel looks nice and it is furnished in a way you would expect from a 4star place the service was very friendly and we had a decent time overall however we had a few problemseach minor but collectively annoyingduring our stay1 we arrived to find stains on our sheets and no soap in the bathroom and because we had arrived late we had to change the sheets ourselves 2 the walls between us and our neighbors were surprisingly thin at one point we could hear the local newscast on the tv next door as if it were showing in our room 3 this was the kickerit happened to rain on our last night there and all the water off the roof drained right onto a metal windowsill outside our window needless to say we slept very poorly even after housekeeping gave us some earplugs if it rains do not stay on the 4th floor interestingly when i complained to the front desk she said many of the guests had made similar complaints and that the hotel management was pushing for a renovation i won t be staying again until they do ,negative,0,0,0,2
needs work this is the third sofitel property my husband and i stayed at the other two were in europe we were fairly happy with the previous bookings and so we decided to try sofitel los angeles details were awry at this hotelath mirror placed too far to be useful dust on the furniture a toilet that splashed when flushed one robe provided instead of two knocking on the door and waking us early in the morning to deliver the newspaper instead of just leaving it so we may sleep undisturbed with the exception of the person who woke us up with the newspaper the staff was generally nice and helpfulhough more training would not hurt we probably would not recommend this sofitel property ,negative,0,0,0,2
great affordable location we chose to stay here on the advise of a friend that said the location was central to sites and studios in the area and the hotel was a good value they were right on all counts and the staff could not have been nicer and more helpful in getting us directions and dinner reservations the rooms were in very good shape and the property appears to have been recently remodeled the pool area was nice and sunny in the afternoon which was nice after a day out walking rodeo drive which is about a mile away for the location price and service we will definetly stay here again ,positive,4,0,4,4
good surprise we recently stayed at this hotel because we needed to be in beverly hills for 2 nights and the four seasons was sold out well that turned out to be a good thing for us i will no longer jump to spend over 500 night to stay at this four seasons there s nothing wrong with the crowne plaza at one third the price you get a comfortable bed spectravision good housekeeping a very decent room and a great location and it doesn t cost a fortune note if you need quiet which we do make sure to book the top floor it s the designated quiet floor we were fine up there no it doesn t compare to a 5 star hotel but neither does it s price for what it is it s above average don t be afraid to use it ,positive,4,0,4,3
stay away at all cost we stayed there 3 days out of a weeks stay in the area nice hotel small rooms but the noise from people working in the hall ways was horrible not 8 to 5 during the day but 23 in the am they have all mexican workers doing the work who not only work all hours of the day and night but they also sleep in the hall ways and the linen closets i called several times to speak to the hotel manager and was told but the front desk that he was looking into it but never seen anyone take any action people where so pissed over the noise they where checking out 4 am as i did at 5 am on the third day of our stay because of the fighting in the hallways in the middle of the night the mother company of crown plaza gave us 500 for our trouble and picked up our other hotels tab the hotel itself is run 100 by mexicans and they harbor people not only in the stairways but the parking garage for cheap labor on the hotels refurbishing stay away at all cost          ,negative,0,0,0,1
got an upgrade we arrived at this hotel in the small hours of the morning and were given a room on the 4th floor when we tried to get into the room the lock was on the door so my husband went down to reception to find out what was going on we were told that sometimes the locks do catch but that we would be given an upgrade to an executive room on the 12th floor room was large and had a king size bed bathroom not very big but adequate with plenty of towels hairdrier and cosmetics on the bed was a gauze bag with earplugs sleep mask and lavender linen spray we had breakfast in the dining room and both the buffet and the ala carte menu were good large servings and well cooked and presented the staff were very attentive and friendly also ate dinner there one night and thoroughly enjoyed it reception staff were very helpful when i needed to find a book shop even providing me with a map so i knew exactly where i was and how far the book shop would be i would recommend this hotel ,positive,0,4,0,4
awful this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in however it holds the hotel of the year award for 2001 for the chain but hey do not appear to have any clean bed sheets i found black hair and big yellow puddle stains on the sheets mattresses and comforters i requested to move rooms and the new room had the same problems housekeeping came and tried to clean the bed but had to open new sheets because the replacement sheets also had stains this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in based upon the quality of the bedroom what a disgusting hotel i checked out the same day ,negative,0,0,0,1
not rodeo drive but excellent stay this is a good hotel located a few blocks from rodeo drive  20 min walking with lots of facilities the room was very comfortable bed was great lots of pillows to choose spacious bathroom was good though a little bit old for la you have to have a car so the hotel is quite nice located the beverly drive has some shops and a lot of restaurants which are worth looking at you can walk to rodeo drive and take a cab back better than trying to find a parking place hotel has a garage about 16 dollar day free internet restaurant was ok but very dark and old we did not have breakfast there but they brew starbucks coffee there there is a supermermarket around the corner where coffee and fresh pastries bagels etc are available so best option for breakfast ,positive,3,3,0,4
liked the hotel but reception staff were a bit dizzy recently stayed at the crowne plaza for 4 nights with husband and 8 month old baby we were part of a large group and had 7 rooms booked at the hotel we arrived and booked in but this took a while as the receptionist didn t really know what she was doing eventually we got checked in and went to our rooms reception also misadvised 2 of our party and said they were only booked in for 3 days instead of 4 which was incorrect but did cause us to worry the room was clean and tidy and had a large very comfortable bed the rooms were quiet and dark and we had a good view  we were on the 9th floor the room also had tea coffee facilities which was great for us to warm bottles baby food breakfast was buffet style or you could order off the menu the food was tasty and they had a good selection also they were accomodating for babies and had high chairs available hotel is well placed in beverly hills and was just a short walk to supermarket bars and restaurants and is close to rodeo drive felt safe walking round in the evening spoke to the concierge to book a trip to see stars homes etc  and we got a really good deal as there were 13 adults and 2 infants we were able to hire our own mini bus to take us to all the major sights and we could stop when we wanted to take photos we also booked the minibus to take us to and from universal studios and to the aurport which worked out much cheaper than using standard taxis would stay at this hotel again as it is very clean and comfortable and in a great location they just need to train their reception staff a bit better ,positive,4,4,4,4
not what you expect stayed at the crowne for 6 nights just because it is in beverly hills does not mean it is top of the line the rooms were very small the bathroom was rediculously small  take one step in turn around and sit on toilet step in shower or wash hands prison cells are bigger than this  staff was very pleasant and helpful bartender not very friendly plenty of sitting space in lounge and check in area we stayed on the 8th floor which included a small refrigerator  nice admenity  ,negative,3,0,0,2

nice hotel not great tourist area we stayed at the crowne plaza for 2 nights at the end of our world tour the hotel was nice clean and the staff were very friendly we were given a large room on the 7th floor it was surprisingly big with 2 double beds free internet access at 2 computers in the lobby is available tho there is usally a queue the 1 major complaint i have with the hotel is the location there isn t much to do after dark there are a couple of nice places to eat on pico one diner which serves amazing lunch and a pretty pricey restauant both about 5mins walk from the hotel but other than that there s nowhere to hang out rodeo drive is a good 1520min walk and here you ll find some eateries on the way  bring your visa card   we struggled to find places to shop after saving alot of money to go mad here i came home with alot of it also car hire is a must we had been warned of this before but decided that as we were only here for 2 days and were arriving on st patricks day  we re irish so didn t want to be unable to enjoy a drink    anyway we spent a fortune on taxis and i m convinced they went halfway round the world for a short cut so be careful the slight negative thing i would say about the hotel is that we tried to order room service albeit at 10 50 when they stop at 11 but they made no effort to find us an alternative or offer something that takes a few minutes to rustle up other than that no complaints ,positive,4,4,3,4
a nicely located hotel with friendly staff and good services we had a good time here the room was nice the staff were very friendly and accomodating to our family its an easy walk to cafes and restaurants nearby and the neighbourhood felt very safe to walk around at night even with small children the pool jacuzzi was an instant hit with our 7 year old its the sort of hotel that grows on you because the staff make you feel comfortable and at home which is what you want on vacation i ve stayed in a lot flasher hotels which i ve left feeling not as satisfied as i did staying here they could do with another internet computer though one doesn t seem to be enough at busy times ,positive,4,0,0,4

reliable option in los angeles i recently stayed at the crowne plaza beverly hills for 3 days in june 2006 and i have to say i have only one real complaint although the complaint i have is not to be undervalued we arrived a little after 300 pm and were told that our room was not ready this is of course a little unnerving after travelling for about 7 hours but understandable if the problem is taken care of quickly we waited for over an hour before being let into our room which was not even made up to drop off our luggage we decided rather than sit in the hotel and wait for our room to be cleaned we would go exploring we came back to the hotel several hours later and our rooms were finally cleaned this was the only real complaint i had during our stay but as i said it is a really big complaint the best thing about this hotel are the beds i have stayed in many intercontinental hotels most recently in atlanta and i must say they have the most comfortable hotel beds i have ever slept in it is good to see that intercontinental has made the commitment to upgrade the crowne plaza hotel range bedding as well even if there was no featherbed the hotel decor is very much like a holiday inn but this is considered a value hotel and no one should expect the ritz when staying here the continental breakfast served in the mornings for priority club members is a wonderful value and just the thing to start a busy day of exploring and shopping another hotel perk so to speak was the use of the 24 hour fitness gym about a 1 4 of a mile down the road from the hotel the facility has workout machines free weights cardio machines as well as organized classes which can all be accessed by crowne plaza guests for free now as for the hotel s location anyone coming to los angeles should understand that no location in los angeles is ever entirely convenient if you do not have a car it is very hard to move around the city the crowne plaza is only a 15 minute walk to rodeo dr and is right on beverly which has a number of restaurants and shops all within walking distance of the hotel if you can handle a tedious checkin as we did the crowne plaza is a reliable valuehotel option in los angeles within reasonable driving distance to many attractions and offers guests comfortable beds complimentary fitness center privileges and a good continental breakfast what more can someone ask for in this price range ,positive,2,4,4,4
expected more i stayed at this hotel for three nights based on reviews from tripadvisor after arriving on a 13 hour flight we just wanted to check in and sleep we were told our room would be ready in half an hour and they would let us know when it was ready we waited patiently in the foyer    two hours later i asked what was happening and was told oh sorry i forget to let you know  your room was ready over an hour ago exhausted and frustrated we finally made it to bed the room was nice  spacious and clean but the walls were paper thin and we were kept awake at 1am with television and converstation in the next room we could hear word for word what they were saying i am a priority club member and was given the free breakfast which was very good on the last day the concierge arranged for a town car to take us to the airport five minutes after booking he called our room to confirm that it was indeed booked when the town car never showed up we asked the bellman about it who asked somebody else who said oh yeah    he cancelled five minutes later we were told that it was never booked at all we were left to find our own way to the aiport the location is in the middle of nowhere i would not stay here again ,negative,0,4,0,2

great place great value  stayed at the crown plaza for 5 nights at the beginning of this month at the start of two weeks touring booked direct on the intercontinental website paying 99 dollars a night  came to a little more in the end with taxes etc however this was brilliant value compared to most uk hotels  as a tip its worth joining this hotel groups priority club as you get a complimentary conti br fast plus rooms on certain floors i m not sure if these are better rooms however they were certainly large and well equiped i liked the location it felt safe  for la  had its own adequate parking and was quiet within the car park is a car rental firm  midway  worth considering if this is your first night away as i had an hours wait at the airport for my rental car definately would stay again when in la ,positive,5,0,5,4
disappointed after driving down from san francisco to la in early january 2004 we were expecting everything the crowne plaza however was disappointing the room was nice but cramped for two people the bed next to the bathroom just managed to allow the door to open but you could hear everything going on in the bathroom so not very private the water wouldn t drain whilst taking a shower so we stood in shampoo soap and conditioner until stepping out we called maintenance up who fixed it but the problem still occurred honestly we couldn t be bothered calling again the use of the internet downstairs in the lobby was good the nightlife on the strip on a thursday night was non existent and very disappointing venice beach fared better the following day ,negative,3,0,0,2

if you are looking for upscale don t look here even though i was upgraded to a nice sized one bedroom suite  i was staying free on my priority club points this hotel that touts itself as a luxury hotel and believe me this hotel is not luxurious they have renovated recently so the public areas seem pleasant at first glance however when you take a closer look the public areas are very dirty and not well maintained there was gum stuck to the wall in the lobby all 3 days i was there filthy glass entrance doors trash on the elevator floors dirty carpet etc the room seemed pretty clean except for the hair all over the bathroom floor gross the room itself had some nice touches but overall felt like an older holiday inn trying to disguise itself as something nicer service was indifferent except for the great concierge was helpful also not very luxurious was having to go out the front lobby doors to get to the pool which is located next to the street the club lounge was your basic hotel room with a cheap continental breakfast convenient but nothing special valet was understaffed  just the one bellman on staff one evening i had to get the car myself from the garage because he was too busy crowne plaze also announced it s new luxurious beds the bed was nice because it was brand new but actually very firm and not high quality location is ok if you have a car but not too much around walking distance this hotel is fine for basic no frills accomodations if you get a good low rate i wish i hadn t used my points here tho kind of a waste i would have stayed at a nicer holidayinn express ,negative,3,3,2,2
not a good experience the location is perfect for shopping and restaurants the lobby is beautiful    we checked in and once in our room realized it was cold we turned on the heater and waited for 3 hours the room never got warm     apparently the windows were not sealed they moved us to another room this room extremely hot    and the air conditioner did not work they move us a third time this room was small but it appeared to have working heat and air it was 130 am before we could finally settle down and rest the hotel management did not apologize or even offer an explanation   in fact the person at the front desk was rude we checked out the first thing the next morning and went to the hyatt which was wonderful i would never stay at this hotel again i understand things happen an apology would have been nice ,negative,4,0,0,2
a complete turnaround absolutley wonderful    the renovations made at this hotel have made a world of difference from the rue royale they now have 16 plasma tvs  hardwood floors throughout the hotel i do not even have this at my home these old reviews about the hotel royal should all be voided this hotel is absolutley fanastic ,positive,0,0,0,4

don t stay here when we checked in there were 6 other groups waiting   no clerk in sight after about 20 minutes someone show up the rooms are dirty and unkept we had no towels in the room after asking several times finally at 1130pm we got 1 towel for the whole room we were going to stay two night but decided not to go through that again so checked out the next morning of course no refund even though the reason we were not staying was because of the service 240 down the drain do yourself a favor and go somewhere else ,negative,0,0,2,1
don t make my mistake i have read the reviews of this property albeit too late i have just returned from a stay at the royal inn unfortunately i must agree with the majority of trip advisor users this was the worst hotel experience of my life that includes an overnight emergency stay at the travellodge in downtown chicago where some of the rooms must have rented by the hour this property is filthy the staff is uncaring and or inept i m not sure if they even have an onsite cleaning staff i certainly never saw any while i was there and my room was never cleaned the shower was dreadful the trickle of water was unbelievable i kept waiting for the pressure to build but it never did i m suspicious that the review about the upgrade to a master suite is a planted posting unless they didn t post for a long time after their trip i was just there  latenov and saw no evidence of any improvements being made many are needed  ,negative,2,0,0,1
welcome to my nightmare management cancelled our two rooms less than 24 hours before we were scheduled they put us in their sister hotel st helene but not with the same accomodations  balcony two beds kitchen that we paid dearly for i fought over the phone and after we got there our rooms had at least a balcony and a kitchen but they were in separate buildings  we weren t all together and the kitchen was useless  there was nothing in it   pots plates silverware  nothing we were there five days and our room was cleaned one time and that we had to ask for and then she made the bed over the dirty sheets do not stay here  it was our worst hotel experience ever ,negative,0,0,0,1
unbelievable we have been staying at the rue royale for years it used to be a quaint inn with an acceptably shabby ambiance that you come to expect and even desire in new orleans with new management it has become a nightmare   we decided to brave the unspeakably tacky lobby renovation due to the fantastic location of the property and visit as a group to celebrate a friend s birthday we booked in july on wednesday night before we were to arrive on friday morning we got a call informing us that our rooms had suffered a water leak and our reservations had been cancelled they refused to help find other rooms basically telling us that they were sorry but managements decision was final nola was booked for the timeframe  1 day in advance so we had to cancell our trip the nicest thing i can say about the management at this point is i hope someone catches them in a crosswalk so their new nickname can be speed bump  ,negative,0,0,0,1

acceptable the sofitel is probably hit or miss and for me it was a miss the hotel looks nice and it is furnished in a way you would expect from a 4star place the service was very friendly and we had a decent time overall however we had a few problemseach minor but collectively annoyingduring our stay1 we arrived to find stains on our sheets and no soap in the bathroom and because we had arrived late we had to change the sheets ourselves 2 the walls between us and our neighbors were surprisingly thin at one point we could hear the local newscast on the tv next door as if it were showing in our room 3 this was the kickerit happened to rain on our last night there and all the water off the roof drained right onto a metal windowsill outside our window needless to say we slept very poorly even after housekeeping gave us some earplugs if it rains do not stay on the 4th floor interestingly when i complained to the front desk she said many of the guests had made similar complaints and that the hotel management was pushing for a renovation i won t be staying again until they do ,negative,0,0,0,2
needs work this is the third sofitel property my husband and i stayed at the other two were in europe we were fairly happy with the previous bookings and so we decided to try sofitel los angeles details were awry at this hotelath mirror placed too far to be useful dust on the furniture a toilet that splashed when flushed one robe provided instead of two knocking on the door and waking us early in the morning to deliver the newspaper instead of just leaving it so we may sleep undisturbed with the exception of the person who woke us up with the newspaper the staff was generally nice and helpfulhough more training would not hurt we probably would not recommend this sofitel property ,negative,0,0,0,2
the jewel in the crowne we won this holiday on the radio when we arrived at lax we were met by a shuttle service approx transfer time was 1 hour due to traffic and other drop off s check in was very straight forward they asked us if we would like to leave a credit card imprint or not there was no pressure to do so the room was a decent size with 2 queen sized beds and a large bright bathroom with shower and bath the room also had a cd player and a large television and coffee maker the ice machine was just down the hallway the location of the hotel was a little out of the way and without a car it would have been a struggle getting about i can highly recommend the car hire company under the hotels parking lot breakfast was excellent and plentiful overall for location and facilities this hotel was a little overpriced but what the heck it cost us nothing  i would stay here again as it made an ideal base for a fantastic holiday and will be in our memories forever ,positive,2,5,2,3
good surprise we recently stayed at this hotel because we needed to be in beverly hills for 2 nights and the four seasons was sold out well that turned out to be a good thing for us i will no longer jump to spend over 500 night to stay at this four seasons there s nothing wrong with the crowne plaza at one third the price you get a comfortable bed spectravision good housekeeping a very decent room and a great location and it doesn t cost a fortune note if you need quiet which we do make sure to book the top floor it s the designated quiet floor we were fine up there no it doesn t compare to a 5 star hotel but neither does it s price for what it is it s above average don t be afraid to use it ,positive,4,0,4,3
stay away at all cost we stayed there 3 days out of a weeks stay in the area nice hotel small rooms but the noise from people working in the hall ways was horrible not 8 to 5 during the day but 23 in the am they have all mexican workers doing the work who not only work all hours of the day and night but they also sleep in the hall ways and the linen closets i called several times to speak to the hotel manager and was told but the front desk that he was looking into it but never seen anyone take any action people where so pissed over the noise they where checking out 4 am as i did at 5 am on the third day of our stay because of the fighting in the hallways in the middle of the night the mother company of crown plaza gave us 500 for our trouble and picked up our other hotels tab the hotel itself is run 100 by mexicans and they harbor people not only in the stairways but the parking garage for cheap labor on the hotels refurbishing stay away at all cost          ,negative,0,0,0,1
enjoyed my stay my wife and i stayed at the crowne plaza for five nights the checkin went smooth the room was spacious and clean and the restaurant and bar offered tasty and reasonably priced food and beverages the staff was friendly knowledgeable and answered all of our questions with skill the hotel location was great and convenient to numerous beverly hills restaurants within a ten to fifteen minute walk up beverly drive were food establishments in all price ranges boutique shopping and upscale rodeo drive i would recommend the hotel to anyone without hesitation ,positive,4,4,4,4
awful this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in however it holds the hotel of the year award for 2001 for the chain but hey do not appear to have any clean bed sheets i found black hair and big yellow puddle stains on the sheets mattresses and comforters i requested to move rooms and the new room had the same problems housekeeping came and tried to clean the bed but had to open new sheets because the replacement sheets also had stains this hotel is one the worst i ve ever had the misfortune to stay in based upon the quality of the bedroom what a disgusting hotel i checked out the same day ,negative,0,0,0,1
not rodeo drive but excellent stay this is a good hotel located a few blocks from rodeo drive  20 min walking with lots of facilities the room was very comfortable bed was great lots of pillows to choose spacious bathroom was good though a little bit old for la you have to have a car so the hotel is quite nice located the beverly drive has some shops and a lot of restaurants which are worth looking at you can walk to rodeo drive and take a cab back better than trying to find a parking place hotel has a garage about 16 dollar day free internet restaurant was ok but very dark and old we did not have breakfast there but they brew starbucks coffee there there is a supermermarket around the corner where coffee and fresh pastries bagels etc are available so best option for breakfast ,positive,3,3,0,4
thanks bobby my grandaughter and i stayed here in november 2007 we loved the hotel  although it was a bit far away from places where we wanted to see we used the valet service most times and found this excellent the drivers were great and very helpful we can t speak highly enough of the doorman come porter bobby who went out of his way to help us with our tour problems we had to leave a day early but this was no problem with the desk staff once again thanks to you all  ,positive,3,2,0,4
not what you expect stayed at the crowne for 6 nights just because it is in beverly hills does not mean it is top of the line the rooms were very small the bathroom was rediculously small  take one step in turn around and sit on toilet step in shower or wash hands prison cells are bigger than this  staff was very pleasant and helpful bartender not very friendly plenty of sitting space in lounge and check in area we stayed on the 8th floor which included a small refrigerator  nice admenity  ,negative,3,0,0,2
comfortable hotel we stayed at the crowne plaza for 2 nights as part of a 4 week us honeymoon the travel agent recommended this hotel for a short stay the room was of a good size though the bathroom was absolutely tiny  i have found this across most of the us  only one person could be in there at a time the staff were friendly and helpful the lady at the little tour desk downstairs could not do enough to help us with booking our tour there was a lot of australians staying here which we really liked as we were really only in la for about 36 hours it was hard to tell if it was an ideal location or not but we enjoyed it while there we walked a couple of blocks to find quite a few restaurants down sth beverly boulevard and chose one of these to eat at the first night the second night we took a cab and managed to get into mortons for dinner and it was divine overall a good place for a short stay ,positive,3,3,0,4
don t be fooled by the location or title i stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel i have ever had you would think with the crowne plaza name and beverly hills location it would be great but don t let the name fool you the first night i stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster  close to the elevators  mistake 1  the a c unit worked but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and i had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the a c off while doing some work i noticed a random previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall it was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall after crushing it   good times the room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought   a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway without turning sideways  not an issue for me but keep it in mind if it applies to you to top it all off the free internet access was painfully slow they provide you with the cheapest cat5  ethernet cable i have ever seen so my biggest tip to the business traveler is bring your own network cable they do offer wireless but i got a whopping 1 bar  i e very low signal strength on my laptop so it was useless i changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5 which was much better but the overall experience could not be undone   not to mention the fact that the room rate was 249  night which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel my last visit to the century city area had me staying at the intercontinental on ave of the stars this is a phenomenal hotel that i could not more highly recommend look for my review of this on tripadvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead ,negative,4,0,1,1
abysmal treatment at the crowne plaza beverly hills we had two rooms booked at the crowne plaza beverly hills which were booked by our tour operator approximately six months ago on arrival in la we mistakenly went to the crowne plaza beside la airport  our tour operator gave us the wrong address  when we attempted to check in there they directed us to the crowne plaza beverly hills but only after phoning themfirst to confirm that we were definitely booked in there when we arrived at the crowne plaza beverly hills at approximately 7 45pm having driven almost 400 miles that day to get there we were told that we were on the guest list but that our rooms were not available as some other guests had wanted to extend their stay they offered to book us into the intercontinental hotel for the night but then had the audacity to say that we that we should come back down to the crowne plaza in the morning for breakfast  they told us this was only about two blocks away but in fact it was about six  when we asked if our rooms would definitely be available the following night the receptionist did not seem too sure he at least seemed a bit embarrassed by the situation but the other receptionist on duty implied that we should be grateful that we were going to a five star hotel instead what was even more annoying was that shortly afterwards a large party of russian tourists arrived and checked in so they obviously did have rooms available the upshot of this was that when we arrived at the intercontinental  in a taxi paid for by the crowne plaza after a struggle we realised that it was indeed a far superior hotel and our tour operator was very helpful in arranging for us to stay there for our second night in la too ,negative,0,0,0,1
it could offer more i stayed at the crown plaza beverly hills for 4 nights and the only thing i can say is that it was just ok when booking the room i asked for an early checkin if possible  at 1230 pm instead of the regular 300 pm  arriving there my room wasn t ready and they didn t make too much effort to find me another one so ok i went out to have lunch and returning after 300 pm the room was available and fine next day i went down to have breakfast and they told me that i had booked a room with continental breakfast so if i wanted to have the hot dishes  full breakfast i would have to pay extra usd 5 ok again usd 5 is not much but i think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast if they had full breakfast available ok i could have paid the extra 5 bucks but why didn they include it in the room rate i found it very constraining that waiter had to check what i had for breakfast in order to issue the bill for this kind of details i guess it was just ok ,negative,0,3,2,0
ok hotel we enjoyed our stay at the crowne plaza we moved here from the hilton anaheim and the crowne plaza seemed really small in comparison the room was a bit tight for four people beds were comfortable and there was a good view from the room the staff were friendly and were helpful when booking town cars etc with regards to location it is about 30 mins from lax and 40 mins to universal studios it takes about 15 minutes to walk to rodeo drive and there are plenty of nice restaurants along the street for a bite to eat overall the hotel was nice and not too large but i would probably try somewhere else the next time ,positive,3,0,0,3
we had no problems here we found this hotel to be clean and the staff very helpful i wouldnt say its overly central to anything in particular but had no complaints about anything here we did book one tour through the hotel which ended up being a bit average the tour guide was a joke this of course is not the fault of the hotel though ,positive,0,0,0,3

very nice overall my wife and i visited la for the first time this past june and the crown plaza turned out to be a good choice located on the fringes of beverly hills the neighborhood was clean and safe most of our sightseeing was confined to west la and the beaches so the location was convenient the hotel itself is generally well kept and the staff without exception was very friendly and accommodating the complimentary continental breakfast  for priority club members a free service  was a good alternative for those mornings when we wanted to grab something and go we d certainly stay here again the clarks cape coral fl ,positive,4,4,0,4
expected more i stayed at this hotel for three nights based on reviews from tripadvisor after arriving on a 13 hour flight we just wanted to check in and sleep we were told our room would be ready in half an hour and they would let us know when it was ready we waited patiently in the foyer    two hours later i asked what was happening and was told oh sorry i forget to let you know  your room was ready over an hour ago exhausted and frustrated we finally made it to bed the room was nice  spacious and clean but the walls were paper thin and we were kept awake at 1am with television and converstation in the next room we could hear word for word what they were saying i am a priority club member and was given the free breakfast which was very good on the last day the concierge arranged for a town car to take us to the airport five minutes after booking he called our room to confirm that it was indeed booked when the town car never showed up we asked the bellman about it who asked somebody else who said oh yeah    he cancelled five minutes later we were told that it was never booked at all we were left to find our own way to the aiport the location is in the middle of nowhere i would not stay here again ,negative,0,4,0,2
lovely we stayed here at the end of april 06 and had no problems clean service was good  breakfast good  you are entitled to it only if you register online as a priority club member before making reservation  which is free  staff friendly and helpful while the hotel is further out everything else is also spread out so no hotel is central unless you want to pay 300 u s  night in hollywood would recommend renting a car no matter where you stayed as this would eliminate expensive taxis would stay here again ,positive,3,4,3,4
excellent hotel  great location stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our 15 night stay in the usa booked the hotel through the holiday inn website  as a priority club member  which is free to join  was very surprised at the rate quoted  only 99  tax we booked a 2 x queen bed room  non smoking upon arrival at the hotel  following the excellent driving instructions from the website we were checked in prompty and very effeciently and directed to our rooms as a priority club member tey have special floors in certain hotels  we arrived at our rooms and were very very impressed wth what greated us high floor view of la with the hollywood sign in the distance 2 queen beds with feather duvet feather topper and great pillows air conditioning that worked and welcome letters from the general manager and priority club manager crowne plaza also have recently introduced a sleep programe  so on the bed was a cd for helping you to drift off into a deep sleep some lavender pillow mist ear plugs and an eye mask all very nice little touches used the hotels valet parking at 18 50 per night  to be honest it is more cost efficeint to use the hotels self parking at only 14 00 per night  as it is under the hotel and you dont have to keep tipping the concierge everytime you need your car keys as a priority club member this also entitles you to a free continental breakfast which includes juices tea coffee yoghurt cereals bagels muffins you can also upgrade for 5 to the buffet breakfast which we did on one morning and had a cooked breakfast all in all i would definetly stay at this hotel again  its location is excellent being on the outskirts of beverly hills and only 2 or 3 blocks from rodeo drive  we felt safe and walked down to a couple of restaurants in the evenings join the priority club to get the comp b fast and the priority floor  ,positive,4,4,3,4

a but shabby and not chic we stayed here for one night in december and i would have to say i would not stay here again we did get a good rate from lastminute so for the price i can t complain too much the lobby is nice enough but the wallpaper in the hallways is peeling there were dishes and plates all along the floor in the hallway the rooms were okay nothing special the hotel is located in an area that s off the beaten path there are restaurants in the hotel and down the road but i just didn t feel comfortable walking there at night with just my young son the staff was all nice enough no problem there we stayed at loews beverly hills around the corner a few weeks before and it was more expensive but much nicer ,negative,2,0,3,3
somewhere between very good  this is the second time i ve been here on business i like the fact that they have free wifi internet and what everyone has said about the staff i double that extremely courteous i only had occasion to eat one meal  room service and it was excellent i was on the club level the room was fine in terms of size the connecting door is a disadvantage ie the tour of italians returned at two in the morning hammered and sat next door and laughed for an hour very loud for me the location was great my client is right up pico about five minutes i d recommend this for people who have never been to so cal and are here on tourism of which there seem to be quite a few here ,positive,4,5,0,4
very nice staff my daughter was having surgery the day i checked into the hotel and we had decided to stay overnight here to make things easier for her and me    the staff was extremely accomodating and very understanding  the refridge that i asked for was brought up immediately and everyone from the valet to the front desk to housekeeping were very polite and nice  the shower did not work properly however   it got cold right away and i thought the valet parking was a little steep at 18  self park was 14 for such an inexpensive hotel  we paid 115  aaa rate   but i would recommend it here  the location to rodeo dr was a hop skip away from this hotel  a great bargain and it was nice and quiet too  i ordered food from their restaurant and the ceaser chicken salad had tons of chicken in it for a change so that was a pleasant surprise also  the amenities were very nice also and we got to keep a pretty silk type bag containing a mini lavender scent sheet spray ear plugs and a black out eye mask which was really cool  i have stayed in much more expensive hotels and never received this kind of amenity ,positive,0,4,4,4
roll out the red carpet i can say i truly enjoyed the hotel upon checkin there is a beautiful lobby and vallet service is efficient and friendly  only a few more dollars per night  i would recommend doing the whole vallet thing because the parking garage is a bit of a pain we probably used the vallet service 3 or more times per day of course coming in and out to see all the different area attractions the rooms are just average  used to be a holiday inn although the beds are luxury first good night sleep i d had in awhile no fan in the bathroom no minifridge or wetbar no balcony although there are beautiful views of the beverly hills downtown area i wouldn t recommend walking to rodeo drive you ll need a car in l a there s no complimentary breakfast  you have to be a priority member  the business center came to a convenience although there is a a charge to use it the pool was too cold in october i don t think it s heated but we got drinks from the bar and enjoyed the whirlpool jacuzzi this is a good place to stay for the cost i think we paid 100 per night i would recommend it more for business than pleasure ,positive,4,0,4,4
totally disappointed i ve booked a room because of its name  crowne plaza but what i found was a terrible hotel the room was dirty and smelly i asked in the front desk for another room but they did not have one at that moment on my 3rd day the bathtub starts to flood i asked again for another room and what i got was another dirty and smelly room stained towels smelly pillows used bandaid in the floor   on the check out i have filled the guest survey but never had an answer for my complains   so   i would not stay here if someone paid me to ,negative,0,0,0,1

great location this hotel is in a great location for rodeo drive lovely clean rooms excellent pool area and freindly staff it is also on 2 major bus routes that link you with downtown los angeles the la subway and santa monica to get to downtown la subway the bus stops right outside the front door to get to santa monica go around the corner to catch the big blue bus on pico blvd the best thing is it is 75 cents to go anywhere on these buses buy a daily travel card for 3 and you can use any bus or subway all day this was the only hotel we saw in such a good location for public transport if you do not fancy public transport there is a taxi rank right outside the door ,positive,4,0,0,4
not as great as promised stayed overnite in a junior suite on the 9th floor i ve stayed numerous times at the rennaissance down the way and wanted to give this place a try the hotel location is great the room was spacious and the decor was chic lots of extras very clean however the room is not well insulated and you can hear your neighbors quite well along with the hollywood boulevard traffic that runs all night  people yelling and taxi cabs honking away  the airconditioning heating furnace appliances are extremely loud and go off and on even when the units are turned off we had unplugged the refrigerator thinking that was the noise in the junior suite the bathroom is enlongated with a shower stall at the very end a tub in front of that and then the toilet next to the door the layout was odd and getting into and out of the shower was awkward poor lighting in the bathroom not a restful stay rennaissance way better ,negative,4,0,0,1
very disappointing we stayed here for four days from thanksgiving we selected it based on the reviews on this site but were very disappointed the price is ok but the rooms were not what we thought we were getting we had booked a suite as we were travelling with our two teenage sons the suite is actually only one bedroom with the second bed in the lounge kitchen area we asked for a rollaway bed  as the boys are unwilling to share a bed and were assured that it wouldn t be too cramped we found that it was very cramped the kitchen was very small and did not have a dishwasher and there were no tea towels to dry things the oven seals kept falling off the moment the oven was heated and the oven door did not fully close there were no dishes in which you could put leftover food we were given one room but the moment we walked in we could smell urine so asked to be moved to another room which the staff did the carpet on the floor was dirty  as mentioned in another review  staff did not come in to clean the rooms until around 5pm which meant that we had already arrived back from being out all day and were getting ready for the night s activities getting luggage to the room was difficult one alternative is to carry them up to the third floor or use the lift the lift is only accessible from the road via the garage the garage is locked and had to be opened for us and the lift is extremely small so only 1 large suitcase  we had 4 in total and carry ons as we had been travelling round the world for the previous 6 weeks would fit in meaning a number of trips had to be taken to bring all of the luggage up the staff were courteous and the location is good ,negative,4,1,2,3
great location if you want to see hollywood we stayed three nights at hollywood orchid suites the location is great one block off hollywood blvd and right behind the mann chinese theater so if you are into the walk of fame and the mann celebrity imprints its for you when we went to universal we took the metro where there is also a station also right around the corner  by the way universal is nothing special  you can also get the metro from to airport people at the front desk were very nice they put us in room 201 the first night and even though the hotel is on a dead end street the room is right over the garage and you could here the entry gate go up and down for every car that came left and the room is right in the elevator corridor so you can hear every conversation going in and out of the elevator adam  i think was his name at the front desk was very gracious and changed our room to one in the back ,positive,4,0,0,4
great price for the location we stayed here recently after reviewing all the reviews of this hotel posted here on tripadvisor we were not disappointed the room was large clean had free coffee mini fridge the hotel also had free internet access on their computer located on the second floor laundry facilities are also available at this hotel and we also liked the fact that the hotel had a security system in place and the parking garage was locked and only hotel patrons had access to it and the parking was free it is literally two minute walk from the chinese theatre and walk of fame in fact i am considering going there again to take my elderly mother there as she will be able to get around and not have to walk far it is in a superb location also we found the staff to be very friendly the hotel is smaller and has a very cozy warm feeling we plan to stay there again on our next trip to la ,positive,5,0,4,0
good location older hotel the hollywood orchid suites has a perfect location behind the walk of fame in hollywood near a lot of restaurants the room was very old but had a living room a equipped kitchen a bedroom and a small bathroom we used our room only to sleep but the hotel has a swimming pool  we don used it and a free pc which you can use for free and even a free printer you could print your flight schedule on it we don liked la very much so we only slept here 1 night i think the price was too high for what you get at the end of the street you have more budget hotels like motel 6 rodeway inn and day inn i would definitely choose that hotels the next time because we don used anything but our beds ,positive,4,0,5,0
great staff great location stayyed at the hollywood orchid suites for a couple of nights from the outside it just looks like a normal building once you got in it was nice the room was huge with a seperate kitchen and dining area didnt really use the kitchen much apart from putting some beer in the fridge but it looked like it all worked ok the pool looked nice but again i didnt use it as was a short stay bit of noise acouple of nights as the walls seem thick but the noise ssems to travel through the doors but it soon went away the best thing about this plae is the location right at the side of the hollywood and highland centre which leads on the walk of fame where there is plenty to see and and places to eat the staff were helpful when had a couple of questions and handed out leaflets with nearst places to eat cinema times ect when i had quesions of how to get to universal studios the guy worked there told me how to get there and back noc harge for leaving luggage eithier all in all good place to stay  ,positive,5,0,0,5
right in the heart of hollywood this place is all about location  if you want to stay somewhere totally central within minutes of the walk of fame kodak theatre etc then this is the place yes it s a bit dated and maybe a bit noisy but it s in the centre of hollywood it s clean spacious with a pool secure parking and free wifi we had a suite with 2 king beds  one in an  almost separate bedroom  with kitchen area we loved that as it meant we didn t have to go out to find breakfast  by this time we were a bit fed up of pancakes  maple syrup eat at trastevere in hollywood  highland just round the corner  a fantastic italian ,positive,5,5,5,0
not for me stayed at this hotel for one night in july one night was plenty we got there early and was told that we couldn t check in because the room wasn t ready we could park there though which was good for us the parking is under the hotel and is accessed only by a locked gate the whole place has locks everywhere locks to the garage locks to the front desk locks to the stairwells i wonder how bad it is that they have to lock everything we walked over to hollywood and highland which looks like a new outdoor mall very nice place within minutes of the hotel we then walked hollywood blvd went back to the hotel and was told we could check in went to our room only to find cleaning ladies still there they rushed out of there they only left two towels for four people i had to go find them to get more towels room was just okay it was really big but very outdated it had a weird smell the bed was extremely uncomfortable very lumpy terrible room was as clean as it could be for a very old place the pool was very clean although we didn t use it the worst part about the whole thing is at 530 am you feel like you re at a freight terminal you re right behind the mall so you hear trucks backing up making deliveries unloading of the trucks and trucks ideling while waiting to unload the whole hotel was up by then or so it seemed this place is alright for one night but imo i wouldn t stay here again ,negative,0,0,1,1
great hotel i stayed in this hotel with my cousin we went to la alot and we always stayed at this hotel it is clean and very big and the pool was great and it is near everything i am gona go back and take my daughter ,positive,5,0,5,0
clean okay for short stay staff very accomodating i was staying in san diego for one week and we decided to drive up to la for one night because it was only for one night and we were only using the facility for sleeping and showering we decided to stay here based on the reviews it was clean and centrally located as described the free parking was another reason for choosing this hotel i would say it was adequate for a short stay i would never want to stay here for any extended period of time for a extended stay on vacation i would be looking for more than bare minimal accomodations i would encourage anyone who is on a budget to stay here however the security is top notch and as i stated it is a great location right behind mann s theatre on hollywood blvd ,positive,5,0,3,4
a detailed review also in comparison to a nearby hotel i was in los angeles for a total of nine days recently the initial four of which was spent here at the orchid suites and they were a good four days unlike the previous reviewer my experience in checkin was pleasant we came in late past 10 pm tired from a 4 hr drive from las vegas on our way over i was worried that our room might be given to another guest so i called to confirm our arrival the person who answered assured me that our room is waiting for us upon arrival the same man who i talked to earlier greeted us with a smile checkin was a breeze good start i thought the last time i was in l a was more than a dozen years ago and my memory of this part of town was that it was seedy but reading the reviews here in t a  i found out that the area has undergone a transformation but unless i witnessed it myself i had my doubts especially since i was travelling with my 7  12 yr olds so security was a major issue i took a chance since i felt that this is the area i wanted to be in the road where the hotel was located is a real quiet road where nary a vehicle pass this despite the presence of delivery trucks to the nearby big hotel and mall the traffic from the surrounding very busy streets of hollywood highland and franklin could not be heard one of the things i liked was that upon checkin you will be given a key  aside from your room key that can open all the other common doors like the entrance and garage doors which were locked safe the garage is located underneath the hotel and was ample it was always full but i managed to find a spot all the time and for those wondering i saw big suvs parked with space to spare transporting your luggage was easy since there was an elevator the room was big generously appointed and clean the look won t win any awards and might even be dated and turn off some but it didn t matter to me i liked the fact that it had a complete kitchen with a ref mini oven microwave coffee maker and plates and glasses even you can save money by preparing meals occassionally a bonus were the mini safe in the closet and the working heater in the bathroom  it was cold when we were there  service was good the front desk staff would suggest activities for the day when they see you in the morning  or at least one did  and they were cheerful when answering my daily querries aside from the ready answers when asking for a great place for breakfast or a nearby grocery store they researched and got back to me when i asked sor something they didn t know  i asked for a nearby church if you must know  and let me repeat the available free wifi you could probably find better accommodations elsewhere but at 139 a day it is hard to fault this hotel okay included breakfast would be nice would i come back i definitely would after my stay here i brought the family to san diego and anaheim but returned to l a for unfinished sightseeing but for comparison s sakes i decided to book at the hollywood celebrity hotel for the 2nd half of our l a holiday let me state that it is hard to choose between the two hotels while i liked everything that the orchid offered the free breakfast at the celebrity may be clincher for some add that to the fact that the latter is 10 cheaper but on the orchid s plus side you feel more secure in it plus it is a more convenient hotel this is expounded in my review of the hollywood celebrity hotel the way i see it if you have a car with you the orchid hotel might be a better deal if you don t the free breakfast and the 10 difference might point you to the celebrity instead personally i d put the orchid suites in front by a whisker  i had a car  travelling with my young ones i like the security and the convenience it offers plus the free breakfast the other hotel offers i offset by buying some bread cereal and juice myself  which is pretty inexpensive  sorry if this review has stretched out the way it did jet lag has given me extra time to write early in the morning  2 am  i just hope i helped you decide if this is the right hotel for you ,positive,0,5,4,5
my only complaint my only complaint is that we stayed there the carpet was so dirty that my feet were black the bed was terrible they were late getting the room ready and while we were walking in they said  in broken english don t touch the walls the paint is still wet the people upstairs was stomping all night even after i called the front desk to complain the bathroom window was open and unable to close   so no showers glad we only stayed 2 nights   but 2 nights toooooo long i will say that the size of the room was nice and the location was great but that is about all i can say nice ,negative,5,0,1,1
good overall but   i booked the orchid after reading fabulous reviews here and the price was very reasonable it s great for a budget hotel and i know i ve stayed at worse the location was pretty good right in the middle of hollywood and nearby the hh mall i had been worried about noise from delivery trucks early in the morning as other travelers have said but i didn t hear any the free wifi was awesome and the room was kept well the roof garden was a nice place to hang out the only drawback was there really was no view didn t use the pool but it looked pretty clean the little patio to our room was a nice touch among my complaints would be the surliness of the check in clerk i guess we had arrived earlier than expected and the woman acted like it was some big hassle to tell me our room wasn t ready yet i was so put off by this i had my boyfriend deal with her when we officially checked in the rest of the staff was great except for her we would have used the kitchenette more but there was a strange smell in there even when we first arrived this is a great hotel for visitors to la and hollywood but their customer service skills are a little lacking  ,positive,4,0,5,3
great stay we had the great privilege of staying at the hollywood orchid suites right at the end of a very long holiday during our holiday we stayed at various hotels and resorts and backpacker accommodations  so we have seen and experienced a little bit of everything we all agreed that this was one of the nicest places we have stayed and apart from all the plusses also the most economic of all our internet booking was responded to very fast and efficient i had to change our booking due to a change in our travel plans and it was dealt with just as efficiently we booked a junior suite and when we arrived we were told that we have been upgraded to a bigger suite  at the same price the room was an absolute delight  big room with two massive beds tv aircon and a big kitchen with dining area after being on the road and eating out of restaurants for 3 weeks it was such a pleasure to be able to cook again the staff at the reception was extremely helpful and gave us very good advice on where to go and what to see the hotel is also ideally situated  right behind the kodak teather  where the oscars are held and also on the walk of fame also a great shopping centre right next to it although many people say that this area is touristy and rundown we did not think so at all well it is touristy but there is a great excitement in the air we only had a day and  in the area so did the walk of fame ripleys  we have a 6 year old   took the bus to santa monica and booked the celebrity house tour  which turned out to be a really interesting tour with regards to la and where things are happening i would definitely stay here again ,positive,5,0,5,5
great location lovely place having just got off the plane in la we were quite jetlagged and tired but this place was relatively easy to find and there was ample underground parking for our hire car the front desk was courteous and we were very quickly checked in and went to our mini apartment on the first floor although it wasn t a beautiful building the decoration was fine and it was clean and felt safe there was a small pool although it was overshadowed by the many buildings around it and when we went in winter it looked pretty cold the location was amazing  round the corner from the center of hollywood with easy access to the underground trains and the main highways of los angeles only negative points about the location were that it was right next to the back entrance of a large mall  great for easy access but meant we were occasionally disturbed by distribution trucks we booked a selfcatering apartment that came with most basic kitchen items although filters for the coffee maker would have been much appreciated ,positive,5,0,4,4
awesome i have just returned with my friend after my second stay at this great hotel  i will certainly be staying here again when i next visit fantastic spacious room fully equipped kitchen really comfortable beds most importantly it was really clean the staff were really lovely very helpful and courteous even let us check out or our rooms a little late there is free internet access which is really useful the hotel is situated right in the heart of hollywood the surrounding area is really safe enough to walk around at night right next to the hollywood and highland complex which has some great shops and fast food places  on 3rd floor  also right near the metro and buses go from nearby to all attractions if you want something really different to do whilst in town try the dearly departed tour www dearlydepartedtours com which not only shows you famous muder sites but it is very informative and gives you alot of history on old hollywood well worth checking out   it was a real pleasure staying in the orchid suites and i will definitely be returning ,positive,5,0,0,5
excellent location great value clean and confortable have just stayed here for two nights it was excellent it cost us about 45 a night and was well worth it two mins walk from kodak theatre walk of fame etc very clean comfortable suites with kitchen and massive bathroom etc free internet access to catch up on your emails etc staff friendly and helpful decor a bit dated but in terms of value for money and location i think you would struggle to do better than this in los angeles would thoroughly recommend ,positive,5,0,5,0

great location and value for money having never been to la before i had no idea where to start looking there were so many mixed reviews on what part of town to stay in and everything seemed so expensive in the end i took a punt and booked at orchid suits and we were not disappointed while the rooms are dated they are clean and comfortable and the location cannot be beat we had a car so drove around the rest of la but being so close to all the main parts of hollywood was a bonus and there were heaps of shops and restaurants nearby plus all the hollywood attractions it was really easy to park in the undercover carpark and we had a 1bed king room with kitchen facilities that was all clean and tidy and everything worked well if it is 5 star luxury you are after then you will be dissappointed by this place but if it is a clean room with lots of space and good location for a good price then this place is excellent ,positive,5,0,5,0
what a dump we just returned from la to visit our granddaughter i found the orchid online and it seemed ok being on a dead end street enticed us thinking it would be quiet and the price seemed reasonable         well as the proverb says you get what you pay for while having complimentary underground parking i can think of nothing else good the rooms are old and seem to be a converted condo studio apartment deal spacious yes niceno the bed is the worst we have ever slept on and the noise my god we were there on a saturday night and the construction noise sounded as if they were in the basement each time a door slammed or a phone rang or an ambulance raced by you were awakened plan carefully when coming to la and avoid staying at this cute hotel ,negative,1,0,3,0

good hotel  needs updating a bit we stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on out trip to los angeles the hotel is in a great location if you want to see hollywood however la is so big you have to drive to get anywhere else it is directly next to the hollywood and highland mall which is great for shopping restaurants etc the staff were very nice and the parking is really handy our room was large with 2 double beds and a kitchenette which was quite good the dcor is a little worn but everything looked clean it could be quite noisy at night but i think you have to expect this in la the pool was really lovely and we enjoyed having a dip in the afternoon and enjoyed catching some rays on the roof terrace as well we went to universal studios one day on the subway which was really easy the rest of the time we used our car our only issue with this hotel is that i saw a cockroach downstairs in the laundry and vending machine area the area is exposed to the outside and i sure there would not be any in the room but it made me a bit nervous and worried for the last night if i were to go to la again i probably wouldn stay in hollywood as we have seen it now but would go to santa monica etc  ,positive,5,0,0,5
good rooms great location stayed 3 nights when in la great location as mentioned in previous reviews after staying in a few motels on our journey it was nice to have a couch and kitchen to make a home from home for a few days yes the rooms are a bit dated but quite adequate and comfortable great free internet access and loads of secure parking underground we enjoyed our stay here and got a good price for the location booked direct with the hotel if we go back to hollywood i would stay here again hollywood was good but a little bit dirty compared to the rest of la and came away a little disappointed took a while to find nice places to eat would recommend mels diner and also the posh burger place  25 degrees in the roosevelt hotel which are both nearby ,positive,5,0,4,0
location location you cannot get much closer to hollywood blvd the walk of fame chinese theatre than this   this is literally a two minutes walk to the walk of fame the service was fantastic very helpful people even helped find where the resturant we were going to was printed off maps give us some good helpful tips for la the rooms were big roomy and clean bit on the old side but for dollar value and location this place is well worth it also free internet on the second floor which is always handy highly reccommended ,positive,5,0,4,5

best one star rated hotel in my book a one star rating someone needs to look at that this place for a family etc is the best spacious rooms and the location is perfect went with my family a 6 in one suite plenty of room hubby and i even had a seperate bedroom clean kitchen for cooking pool  you really couldn t ask for more their staff was more then accomadating my suburban fit in their 6 4 garage which we thought it wouldnt so parking big plus theres a huge mall right out the front door i can t say enough and i was so nervous because we didn t know area and the one star rating go for it   just skip the tours of famous peoples houses rip off  all you see is bushes  and the bushes are 15feet high save your  thanks orchid we ll be back for sure   ,positive,5,5,5,5
convenient clean and very comfortable we are a family of five who just returned from a short two night stay at orchid suites at the end of a two week multicity vacation the location was very convenient kodak theater and highlands mall next door with well lit access  universal studios and warner brothers studios were part of our sightseeing and both were very easy to reach and only a short drive from the property staff was very welcoming and attentive to all needs questions and assisted with tour arrangements driving directions two king suite was very large and spacious more than adequate room for bags rollaway bed and 3 teenage children kitchen was convenient for drinks snacks rooms appear older but are well maintained clean and comfortable with most ammenities of a newer 4 star hotel at an affordable rate pool made for a relaxing break from or after sightseeing parking very safe secure we would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again if our travels take us back to hollywood area ,positive,5,0,5,5
nice hotel good location right behind grauman s chinese theater and walk of fame very good accommodation clean rooms and friendly staff free parking would absolutely stay again stay away from star line tours which are situated at the chinese theater   bad experience  read review if interested  would recommend having a rental car as you re limited to sights within walking distance  especially at night  ,positive,4,0,4,4
great location this is a great value motel type accomodation we had a large suite with a kitchen  including a table and chairs and balcony decor is a little dated but this is a 2 star property and was what we had expected the location is unbeatable  right behind the kodak theatre  do the tour  very interesting and chinese theatre we could walk thru to the mall  hollywood highland and have a choice of restaurants the first night we were there there was a red carpet event going on  fascinating to see all the trucks and limos and glamorous people this hotel is right next to a super flash 5 property  same location but way different price the pool was a welcome relief after a day at universal studios  one stop on the metro  clean and heated too housekeeping were a bit slow  not done til 5pm on one day and the reception staff were not particularly helpful friendly but these were minor gripes great to have the free safe parking too definately recommended ,positive,5,0,5,3
hidden gem fantastic location hard to find  this place is located behind the kodak theater on a cul de sac you won t find it just by driving by i was visiting a friend who lives in the hollywood hills and she turned me on to the hollywood orchid suites i did not use my car for the 2 days i was there the kodak theater is attached to a mall and the chinese theater and it is all just a few steps from the front door the subway station is there too and proved very convenient the room was clean and very large and the bed was very comfortable there was a kitchen and dining table we did not use but would be very convenient for a family on vacation the pool came in very handy as it was hot those days all in all a very good experience ,positive,5,0,0,0
basic but location makes up for it we stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of our trip and then 2 nights at the end before flying home the location is fantastic and right in the heart of hollywood rooms are very basic and smell rather musty and old however they are well equipped we had the two king suite and used the spare bed to lay all the suitcases on which was useful the kitchen was huge there are some restaurants nearby in the hollywood and highland but the steak grill place turned out to be a disaster some people mentioned the wolfgang puck place was better there is a small store nearby selling breakfast items although the rate we paid was good  129 and tax per night i do feel that it is highly priced for what you get due to the facilities being so old although if two couples were sharing the two king suites it would be a bargain the location makes up for this we did not have any problems during our stay although they do clean the rooms late in the day  3pm  ,positive,5,0,2,0
this is the place we stay in hollywood my family has stayed at the orchid on several occasions and we are very satisfied with it it is not a fancy place but it has a great location if you want to stay in hollywood at a reasonable price on our recent stay last week we had a junior room which had two double beds and a kitchenette we found the beds a bit hard but they were ok we like the secure underground parking especially in the area of hollywood and highland i feel my car was safer than on an open lot the thing we liked the least was the very dirty carpet it turned the bottoms of our feet black very quickly it needed to be cleaned desperately would we go back yes certainly have i recommended the orchid to others yes i have it is not a posh or fancy place but then again it doesn t have posh or fancy prices either ,positive,5,0,4,0
terrific value i stayed at the orchid suites for a week in may 07 with a couple of friends we booked a 2king suite plus a rollaway for about 139 night plus tax this configuration was great for us but it was sort of like 2 bedrooms with a kitchen in betweenif you want a more traditional living room setup there s a layout that replaces the 2nd king with a queensized sleeper sofa other configurations are available as well the kitchen was a real plusin addition to a fullsized refrigerator freezer stove microwave and toaster oven it included dishware silverware  including a corkscrew  a coffee maker wih a daily coffee cream sugar setup salt and pepper and paper towels we saved a lot of money by being able to buy groceries and take home leftovers and saved even more with the free parking the location was greatyou can cut through the back entrance to the highland center and be on hollywood blvd  and at a metro stop in under 5 minutes a 24 hour drugstore  long s and a food market are about 2 blocks down the blvd the hollywood freeway  101 is a straight shot by car just a couple of minutes away there are also onsite laundry facilities and pretty extensive vending machines on the ground floor the negatives are pretty much what other reviewers mentioned tired decor  but clean  a shower meant for short people some outside noise from delivery trucks and passersby on the outer walkways and some ceiling noise from people on the floor above you  did not detect noise on either side though  all in all a terrific valuei d recommend it for families or other travellers who are looking for a convenient costeffective base for sightseeing as opposed to a desination resort ,positive,5,0,5,0
never again the only thing pleasant about this stay was the location the room was a decent size but everything in there was soooo old looking that it was scary the cups and dishes looked like they were rinsed off and put back into the cabinet our microwave looked like it hadn t been cleaned since 1902 eck on top of that the front desk kept calling our room with complaints from people who live in the hotel stating that we were talking too loud    we had to whisper in our room on our vacation unheard of     the front desk called us at exactly 1201 to let us know that it was time for us to check out  duhhhhhhh we were on our way out the door i have been to plenty of hotels and have never had anyone call my room a minute after check out and tell me that it was time to get out rude rude rude sorry but i would rather fork out more money for a nice hotel next time this place was disgusting ,negative,5,0,0,1
great location great hotel this might be the place to be when staying in los angeles located right behind the kodak theatre and hollywood boulevard this is the best hotel i ve stayed in los angeles at 109 night for two person we got a wonderful executive suite with a kitchen which was enough for two people to cook in and four people to eat in the room had sliding door so you could easily walk onto the balcony we had a wonderful view of the hollywood hills bed is comfortable and a huge king size bathroom is excellent and there s a big closet hotel has a pool but we didn t use it since there s so much to do staff very friendly and efficient but my favorites were the cleaning staff all of them were totally sweet and friendly and very helpful and they seemed to appreciate to be able to talk to some of the guests our room was cleaned and left spotless each day location excellent since you can do some shopping very close by and the area is very safe you can easily walke around at night in the area but don t wander to far up hollywood boulevard the block aroud the hotel is very safe up until the gap there s no worries and if you plan a trip to universal studios don t take your car but take the metro since it s close to the hotel and the studios are only one stop away traffic this is la and highways are terrible we went to santa monica from the hotel and took road 66 major road works so we got stuck for quite some time same thing with the highways and if you wanna go to orchid suites coming from hollywood boulevard beware that you are not allowed to make a left turn onto franklin avenue at rush hour i would advice you to turn left onto labrea avenue from sunset or hollywood boulevard and then a right onto franklin ave it s gonna save you a lot of time and trouble and if you get stuck in traffic keep calm and turn up the music parking the hotel has a closed garage only guests can use so no worries there going back home from the orchid suites you have time to spare cause you plane leaves in the evening no worries just ask and you can leave you car in the garage there s table and chairs near the pool except for your room they let you use everything the hotel has to offer great value for the money clean amazingly quiet for los angeles and a safe area ,positive,5,0,5,5
orchid a fine base for seeing la by transit many people have noted the orchid s fine qualitiesprice location helpful staff on that i d only add the recycling bin in the  goodsized kitchenwith a city of la sticker on itsomething i d never seen before in a hotel it s a great idea because i know i wind up throwing out lots of newspaper and paper but this time could recycle them one complaintthe radio part of the clock radio didn t work the clock did you don t have your 40 tv channels but they never have anything good on them anyway the orchid is viewless it s view is the blank back wall of the hollywood highland shopping center that is genuinely only steps from it s worth the tradeoff this trip i didn t rent a car and did finethe orchid was well situated for that i used the red line subway that stops at hollywood highland the fairfax avenuehollywood boulevard bus the sunset boulevard bus etc there s also a lot of entertainment and eateries within walking distance if you want to see la carfree this is a good spot ,positive,5,0,5,5
great location we stayed at hollywood orchid suites for 7 nights during the first week of december we arrived at 8am after traveling from australia for over 16 hours thankfully the staff were great and very friendly and our room was ready for us to check into although the room wasn t the most beautiful place we ve seen it was clean and well presented we stayed in a king executive room which was huge there was a separate kitchen with full size fridge and microwave as well as a good sized table which could seat four the location of this place is fantastic only a few seconds walk from the hollywood highland center and hollywood blvd with all of the touristy sights such as graumann s chinese theater and the walk of fame another huge bonus of the orchid suites is the free internet access offered although there is only one computer we never had a problem with waiting to use it there was a strange smell in the room when we arrived but it turned out to be the cleaning products and didn t really bother us too long the only criticism we have is that the room was a little old and worn out but that seemed to be la in general for the light sleepers remember to pack earplugs  we could hear the person in the room next door snoring every night so loudly it was as though we were in the same room if you choose to stay at the orchid suites just remember you re not paying the high prices of other hotels in the area so don t compare it to those the location couldn t be beaten the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and well maintained which is what we were looking for ,positive,5,0,4,5
new year at the orchid our party of four adults spent new year s at the hollywood orchid having stayed at a few other hotels in west hollywood  noho and downtown i would place the orchid in the same category it s not a palace but if that s what you want then fork over 300 a night and stay at the renaissance or roosevelt see what 150 a night buys you in other notorious tourist traps like london toronto new york etc the orchid has nice large rooms with two completely separate sleeping areas we stayed in room 106 beside the pool and found the place quite adequate for our needs access to the hollywood highland mall is only steps away half the room price could account just for the convenient location alone the parking is quite good the staff friendly and helpful we felt that it was good value for the money and would have no problem staying there on our next visit to la ,positive,4,0,4,4
what a dump yes it is cheap yes it is in a good location but i wish i had paid more at a clean hotel and not felt like i had to wear shoes in the room because i did not want to step on the carpet with my bare feet the widow in the bathroom was caked in dirt and what appeared to be mold the bed was like laying on concrete absolutely horible sleeping conditions i put a towel down in the tub when i took a shower because i didn t want to step on the non skid strips in the tub because they had filth on the side of them yuk fortunately i was only there two nights and could not wait to get out of there my advise    save up your money to stay at a real hotel not some converted apartment building it was a miserable stay ,negative,4,0,1,0
location and value plus spacious my husband and i stayed in one of the king deluxe suites here on a wednesday night it was only 99 there was enough room for 4 to stay comfortably the kitchen was totally stocked with whatever you wanted for cooking and we couldnt believe the extra bedroom it was like staying in an apartment you walk right through this corrider and just like that your in hollywood and highland mall you are literally on the same block as all the happenings in hollywood there was a robin williams premier that night and we just walked in the door of the jimmy kimmel live show and got seats we had a blast with so much to do and the location and price of this hotel was key the staff was very friendly and though the rooms were older it was also clean we will definately be back  ,positive,5,0,5,4
unbelieveably great value the hollywood orchid is literally a 4 minute walk to grauman s chinese hollywood walk of fame and where the tours of hollywood originate and a 2 minute walk to kodak theater center  plenty of restaurants shops etc   you could not ask for a better location for firsttime hollywood visitors but what makes the orchid such a value is that despite it s location it offers spacious suites  and i do mean spacious right in the heart of hollywood with extremely affordable prices highly recommended ohhhh and thanks trip advisor reveiwers for turning me onto this place i ll be back      ,positive,5,0,5,0
fine for a stop in hollywood the hotel is in a great location     behind the kodak theatre and a 2 minute walk to hollywood blvd the rooms  suites are very big as they used to be apartments the place is very dated and our room had a bit of a musty smell not too bad the parking garage under the complex is nice if you have a car the place is good for a stop in hollywood or for a big family or group     as i said the place is dated but very clean we stayed there one night  don t need more than that in hollywood and paid 99 ,positive,5,0,4,0
amazing value excellent location we stayed in a deluxe suite from 11th to 14th april 2006 it s an amazing find the rates are great the location is unbelievable it s located in a cul de sac behind highland and hollywood shopping centre  there s a back door so it only takes a minute to get there with a good range of shops and restaurants and also contains the kodak theatre where the oscars are held and the subway is very near by  which was very easy to use and one stop to universal studios  it s on the same block as the chinese theatre with the walk of fame running along it it s also quite close the freeway which made it easy to find and despite the traffic straight forward to get to disney to in just over an hour the area felt very safe and the accomodation had a good level of security there was free underground locked parking and always free spaces the staff were extreamley helpful and let us keep are car there after check out the property is very well maintained and very clean our apartment was very spacious and clean the furniture is very comfortable and well maintained although it might be a bit dated for some peoples tastes  we had a large open plan lounge with sofa bed armchairs dinning table and four chairs kitchen including microwave and a breakfast bar area we had a seperate bedroom with king bed and there was three large wardrobes the bathroom had a shower there were two televisions and a safe in the room there s a laundrette and an outdoor swimming pool we would not hesitate to recommend this to others and certainly would be willing to return ourselves as we were very impressed ,positive,5,0,5,5
suite location although the room is a little dated having the kitchenette was nice for our family of 4 and the hotel location couldn t be better the parking and internet access are included which is a plus the hotel also has a pool and laundry room we only stayed 2 nites  79 nite for jr suite  but if were staying longer would get a full suite  with full kitchen and microwave  we missed not having a microwave in the kitchenette it is a good value for a suite in a sweet location and would not hesitate to stay here again ,positive,5,0,4,0
very disappointed did we stay at the same place after reading all of the reviews i expcated a lot more from this place i actually wondered if we were staying in the same place i agee with eveyone the location is wonderful could t ask for a better location in addition it also offered free parking and internet access the room was dated carpet was worn and it smelled of stale smoke i did not feel it was clean as a matter of fact the shower curtain had black mildew all over the back the windowsill in the bathroom was just filled with dirt and the placemat on the kitchen table had dried ketchup stuck on it we had a double queen suite on the back bed the there was a hole in the bottom sheet large enough my husbands foot kept getting stuck in it finally the pillows were just awful i was very disappointed and will never stay here again ,negative,5,0,1,0
great value we stayed 2 nights at the orchid suites and were pleased the staff was very friendly my husband got the flu the day we checked in and the woman at the front desk was so concerned and helpful she also made sure we know about special happenings around town the place is not beautiful but very clean and spacious ,positive,0,0,5,5

great value since reading the reveiws here prompted me to stay at the hotel i feel i should contribute i will just be repeating what many others have said price is great  location behind the kodak theatre  close to everything you need room was very big and very clean staff was really very very friendly and helpful  property is very secure parking is free  free wireless access to the internet use of a pc in the lobby if you don t have a laptopthis hotel is a great value ,positive,5,0,5,5
much better than expected for that price beautiful we did not expect to find such a wonderful hotel for the price of 89 per night just right in the heart of hollywood behind the kodak theatre close to everything you need the room was excellent  very big and clean with a nice kitchen the staff was really very very friendly and helpful in providing us with information of any kind the hotel is very secure though there is a safe in the room you don t really need it since getting into the hotel is quite impossible without the key parking is for free  which saved us a lot of money and you have a free wireless access to the internet all in all we highly recommend this hotel for everybody since it was really great we would stay there again any time ,positive,5,0,5,5
bargain in hollywood yes the orchid suites is a bargain in hollywood our family of 6 stayed in a 2 bedroom unit for 2 nites the location is ideal for visiting hollywood and universal studios keep in mind the hotel is old and we did not like the smell kind of old cigarette smell the swimming pool is tiny and not heated while we were there the pool was too cold to swim in we had to wait 20 minutes for our room to be ready at checkin even though i called two hours before arrival and we arrived in the early evening the staff are for the most part very helpful parking was in the underground garage was great with easy access to 101 ,positive,5,,4,3

great location and free parking stayed for 1 night in september and 2 nights in octobergood pointsaround 15 metres from the back entrance to the hollywood and highland centre which the chinese theatre is part of this also connects to hollywood boulevard the area around this complex is the only part of la i felt safe walking around until the early eveningfree underground secure parking with plenty of spacesrooms were very spacious secure and clean and had safe very reasonably priced only 79 a night plus tax in october plus the parking was safe and free bad pointsrooms slightly outdated  but they were clean and excellent value for the priceslightly noisy this was nothing that a pair of earplugs did not fix ,positive,5,0,5,0
perfect location the hotel is clean and parking is free and location is perfect right behind the kodak theatre takes 2 min to get there pls be aware that it s old and not fancy staff was friendly and helpfull ,positive,5,0,4,4
another great stay orchid suites continues to be a great bargain in a prime hollywood location i ve stayed here with family members two years in a row and would certainly return rooms are large with  in many cases a wellequipped full kitchen underground parking is safe secure and convenient pool is a pleasant diversion and wellmaintained i noticed a problem with a loose spotlight in the pool this year reported it to the front desk and was impressed to see it fixed in a matter of hours at some hotels that type of problem means closing the pool for days at a stretch the rooftop garden sunning spot is a great place to relax and watch the activity below the only minor problem this year was with a noisy neighbor above us when i mentioned it to the front desk they asked the family to take another room on the first floor problem solved staffers are friendly helpful and wellinformed we left a video cord behind this year and they tracked it down and mailed it to us at no charge overall a great stay and a great bargain i highly recommend it ,positive,5,0,5,5
great on the wallet this is not a fancy hotel they do not have a large amount of amenities but if this is the area of los angeles you want to stay in it can t be beat for value i stayed here in the past and have reservations to stay again the rooms are outdated but clean and they full kitchen with everything you need is excellent if you can t afford to eat out every meal the location is fantastic and unless you are out at the wee hours of the morning the neighborhood is quite safe i look forward to my next stay ,positive,5,0,5,3
exceded expectations when planning our southern ca vacation i bought several tour books because i tend to overresearch everything this hotel was mentioned in at least one of them i compared it to some others  like magic castle  and this one was more within my budget and sounded ideal i found it a little confusing to get to  hollywood traffic is laughable  but accidentally ended up in the correct lane and made the correct turn at the intersection of a thousand arrows  those who have been there will know what i m talking about  when we entered the room i was absolutely shocked at the size it was huge as others have intimated it s not plush but unless you plan on spending a lot of time in your room it s more than adequate and as others have also said the location couldn t be much better the only negative i can recall is that the suite had two rooms and their was no way to shut off the one room so the girls didn t have as much privacy as they probably would have liked i ve only been to hwood once so have nothing to compare this place to but i wouldn t hesitate to recommend it ,positive,5,0,0,0
cant beat it  i stayed here at the orchids last year my first time to holywood  you just cant beat it  the price is very inexpensive and the location is unreal  literally 100 or so feet to the mall where the kodak theatre is and holywood blvd  security is great door is always locked you must get buzzed in or use your key    the rooms are not a 4or 5 star hotel room but they are very very large it is like you are in a condo or an apartment  mine had a sliding door that led out to a very large patio  and a full kitchen with a door on it thats right in the kitchen  the furnsihing are old but who cares  if you take in consideration the location price and largeness of the room itworks great and also the staff was fine   have fun  ,positive,5,0,5,4
hotel not so good location great i chose hollywood orchid hotel for the location i thought it was going to be alot better by reading other peoples reviews online not so in my case i was told i would get a room with a view and i got a view of a wall the shower s drain wouldn t stay up so i had to turn off the water to soap up my handicap mother who was with me for mother s day couldn t even use the shower because of this parking underground great but if you leave in the evening you won t be parking in the underground garage when you come back  parking very limited i had a coupon for 65 for 2 beds kitchette they said they couldn t honor the price due to weekend so i had to pay 79  90 total  and still had to give them the coupon for that price the place was old and run down i brought my own sheets and blanket which really helped me deal with this place the only thing good about this place is the location you walk underneath the renaissance hotel and your right at the hollywood blvd outside mall kodak theatre and manns chinese theatre if you don t care where you sleep then here s your place personally i would spend a extra few bucks a get a better hotel the roosevelt is just is close and you can get good deals online stay away from room 302 bad    the indians indonesians that run the hotel are nice but don t give a  if something goes wrong in your room sorry is all you ll get ,negative,5,0,1,1
