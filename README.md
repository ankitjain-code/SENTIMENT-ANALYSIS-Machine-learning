Using Hotel reviews Data set from Trip Advisor and SentiWordnet dictionary (an opinion lexicon derived from WordNet database), our approach's sole focus was to gauge consumer sentiment and forecasting comportment using both lexicon features and machine learning algorithms . We conclude by devising a hybrid approach that collectively exhibit accuracy of machine learning techniques and speed of a lexicon approach in automatic and accurate analysis of User(Review) Sentiment.
